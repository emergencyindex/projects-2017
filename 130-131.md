â€œGroundwork/Groundswellâ€ meditates on the idealism that this required to prepare to move forward, when the road may not extend ahead. What is the value of that optimism? What happens when your expectations fall short? In â€œGroundwork/Groundswellâ€ I work to cultivate the ground below, to flood the ground with potential. As I pull the green fabric through my costume, I labor with my body, against my body. I allow myself to feel the pressure on my shoulders, against my ribs. In an attempt to regain optimism, I turn back to the ground by weaving green fabric into the barren floor.

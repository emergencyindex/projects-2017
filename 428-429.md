"Streaming My Stolen Hour (DST III)" marks ten years since my work, "Taking Back The Night (DST I), 2007" and continues to explore the psychically debasing act of turning a clock back to adhere to Daylight Saving regulations. I create a closed-loop system between an analog clock pacing towards the moment of "falling back an hour" and a live stream of my laptop digital screen recording the clock's face so that the image's reflection reflects back in on itself.

My 2007 performance documented me waiting patiently for the time change. This time, the ticking clock as the stand-in for my body and anticipation is served to the online viewer. Upon the conclusion of the first hour, at 2 am, Daylight Saving practice comes into effect and I intervene by manually turning back the clock to 1 am to relive the past hour in d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu fashion.

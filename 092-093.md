In this day-long performance, developed in collaboration with Machine Project and the Los Angeles County Department of Cultural Affairs, I surveyed the dynamic and historical Echo Park in Los Angeles, California. Inspired by lineages and legacies that have shaped Echo Park's history, my body acted as a conduit for its unseen and felt influences and histories, and in particular the Sacred Feminine energy at the park (including Amy Semple McPherson and La Reina de Los Angeles). I weaved zine-making, music, hydromancy, video projection and the geomapping of my face onto the Lady of the Lake into an interactive and community-focused experience. "AngelUS" had four iterations throughout the day, beginning at sunrise and ending just after sunset. The first was a walk around the park while I blasted music and sounds of Amy Semple preaching. The second was an interactive table where people could come learn about AngelUS and Echo Park's history. The third was a divinatory experience over the lake as individuals witnessed myself use the water in the lake as a divination tool. The words and images which emerged from this experience were later used in the fourth and last performance. This performance brought in nine Los Angelesâ€“based performers and took over the south side of the park with video projections, sound, and interactive elements.

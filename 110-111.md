Iâ€™M STILL GOOD

The performance begins with a pile of clean topsoil, and me, blindfolded, in a white dress. There is a bucket of soiled water sitting to my left and I have a sponge in each hand. Kneeling in the dirt, I hold out the sponge in my right hand as an invitation. With my head slightly bowed, I use the opposite sponge to smear the dirt across my body. This action, which is staining the once-pristine dress, holds purifying qualities for me. Drawing reference from ceremonies often practiced within purity culture as well as my life-long residence in the Lutheran faith, I create a space in which my participants and I begin to examine the origins of self-worth. Using dirt as a metaphor for sexuality, I use these actions to solidify a new reality in which oneâ€™s sole worth is no longer contingent upon the preservation of virginity. This space is activated by the interaction of the participants/viewers, which in turn dictates my own interventions altering the ritual. The sponge that I present invites the participants to become part of this ongoing narrative, by altering the situation in whatever way they see necessary. Some choose to partake in smearing the mud across my body, others attempt to undo what has been done, and some do neither but instead use individualized actions to connect to me or the experience. In the end, I struggle slightly before removing the dress and leave behind the physical and conceptual weight that is rooted in the simultaneous development of faith and sexuality.

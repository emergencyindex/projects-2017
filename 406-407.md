In collaboration with the Danish Art Foundation, Verdens Kultur Centret, and Performance KÃ¸kkenet, The International Performance Art Festival Body Landscapes Copenhagen found it a necessity to articulate the individual and collective memory of migrants based in Europe. The project took place at VerdensKulturCentret (NÃ¸rre Allé 7, NÃ¸rrebro) in Copenhagen, which is a cultural center that strengthens the cultural nexus of foreigners in Denmark. Through performance art, the invited artists created a space of interconnectedness between foreigners and locals.

The project was divided into four parts, each of which lasted one week. In the beginning of each week, two artists had a meeting to organize one collective experience (workshop or creative laboratory) and one performance session that was presented during the last Friday of October.

In the performance "On Interior Things" I presented the leaky female body through an enactment of a series of private rituals that express visceral manifestations of internal experience. The work considers the fragile barrier between the inside and outside of the body and the permeability of the skin. The work is comprised of a cycle of silent and repetitive gestures of wounding, staining, and healing.

During the work, I sat on an old wooden chair atop a carpet of aging book pages. I wounded 28 red beets with a vegetable peeler, and put my fingers into the fresh holes. Pieces of the beet piled up on my pink crepe dress, leaving traces and stains upon my lap. When all the beets were marked, I sat on the floor and spit honey into a fresh hole and then cut a small patch of fabric from my dress to cover and mend the wound. This action was repeated 28 times until all of the beets were arranged in a circle on the floor.

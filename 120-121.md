TO BURY MY HEAD IN

FLOUNDER LEE

â€œTrying to Find the Softest Sand to Bury My Head Inâ€ was a performance that was live-streamed to the US. It was both in response to US politics and my growing interest in science-related art. When I made the proposal, the US had just elected Trump; when I performed it (April 1) I was hoping we were going to find out it was a bad prank. I was overwhelmed from all the terrible things that had already started happening because of this bad-joke-turned-president. Even living in Dubai, I was calling my senators and congressional representatives regularly. I just wanted to bury my head and pretend that this wasnâ€™t happening.

As for the method of my performance, Iâ€™d been more and more interested in using the tools of science for my artmaking. I used a microscope with a camera attached. This and the webcam video were live-streamed to the Inverse Performance Art Festival in Arkansas.

During the performance, which was right after sunrise in Dubai and nighttime in Arkansas, I collected sand from various locations with cellophane tape and put them under the microscope to find the softest sand. When not finding the softest sand, I used a rotary tool (Dremel) to create my own sand from rocks. All these specimens were logged and placed in a research notebook.

I never found the softest sand, I didnâ€™t bury my head, and I keep calling my representative (who Iâ€™m proud to say is a Muslim-American). I keep hoping that the national (and international) nightmare is over before too much damage is done.

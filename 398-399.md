How can an invitation isolate?

How can an isolation invite?

The work attempts to incite discourse on the Philippinesâ€™ current political climateâ€”the blatant invitation of the state to a culture of killings, impunity, and injustice that isolates our very humanity. Gathering elements such as visual representations of arrest, confrontation on authority, and reflective textures on the idea of investigation, the work challenges the peopleâ€™s response to these invitations and isolations.

The performance space was divided into two by a â€œpolice line do not crossâ€ tape from the ceiling to the floor. One side was where I was exhausting myself by running relentlessly and bumping my body against the walls of the venue. On the other side, the audience was able to watch the performance. The audience had to look through the tape so they could see me. I added visual elements to evoke the idea of an arrest by putting the tape and red and blue lights on. Also, inside the performance space, I installed two big juxtaposed mirrors so that when the audience watched me, they also watched themselves and those who watched with them.

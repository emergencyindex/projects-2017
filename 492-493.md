A LECTURE PERFORMANCE IN TWO PARTS

SOPHIE SEITA

When is a copy a commentary? This lecture performance was commissioned for the Royal Academy of Arts latest event â€œRrose SÃ©lavyâ€™s Dada Extravaganza.â€ Taking as its starting point the centenary of Duchampâ€™s (or rather: R. Muttâ€™s) rejected Fountain, my performance proposed to â€œseeâ€ the work differently when â€œreadâ€ in the context of Duchampâ€™s co-edited magazine The Blind Man, where it appeared as a photograph by Alfred Stieglitz in 1917. The script meditated on fountains and fountain pens, portraits and replicas, women and bird cages, sequences and consequences. My performing persona echoed the image of the â€œreading womanâ€ (in a dressing gown, draped over a sofa)â€”a common painterly trope and an obsession for philosophers and writers alike as an epitome for â€œattention.â€ My set consisted of a sofa, an arm chair, an empty golden picture frame, and a pedestal on which I placed a heart-shaped bar of soap in homage to Duchampâ€™s co-editor Beatrice Wood, who exhibited her semi-ready-made Un peut [sic] dâ€™eau dans du savon also in 1917.

My impetus was to rectify a particular historical account and hagiography around Duchamp and to take seriously the question of how Fountainâ€™s conceptual stunt and its social and cultural context can do some work for us aesthetically and politically today. This was less about â€œrelevanceâ€ than about a different understanding of contemporaneity (something Iâ€™ve called a â€œmovable contemporaneityâ€ elsewhere). How materials that are historicalâ€”both mine and not mineâ€”can have an afterlife (or multiple lives) is something thatâ€™s been preoccupying me for a while now. Consequently, the performance also reflected on reading as interpreting, performance as research, and how we make art history beyond major exhibitions dedicated to the big daddies of Dada and Surrealism. One challenge was how to present such experimental work to an audience primed for entertainment, dressed as Surrealist paintings and taking their plastic lobsters for a walk.

I had initially been asked to perform the same piece twice, butâ€”not wanting to be the replica I addressed in my performanceâ€”I decided instead to make seriality, copying, and re-reading an integral element of my script, to create two parts that worked independently and in conjunction. The script included material from my piece 3,4 (2013), copied to serve a new function, and the performance concluded with me blindfolding myself, not-seeing my video Objects I Cannot Touch (2014) play in the background.

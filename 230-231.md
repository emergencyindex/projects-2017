SMELLS AFTER IT RAINS

ALEHA SOLANO

An unknown character portrait reasons for discontent and rejection, the ruptures of self-love tinged with anguish and loneliness. The daily life of a street, an independent and public place / space, serves as a favorable confrontation for a critical look towards the sociocultural canons governing the civilization that we are currently amassing.

Elements were taken from the fullness of human relationships and their social context as a starting point to address the totality of life as it is lived through the years, in a dynamic social environment. An ordinary sidewalk in a street where there's nobody else as an audience but the neighborhood residents, college students, and young couples with kids.

I reflect on the everyday-ness of the body's memory using 100 colorful men's t-shirts, folding them, setting them in a line along two blocks from the art gallery until I reach a public park, then dragging them like the heavy load of our humanity that we carry on our backs, making some knots as a metaphor for the resilience in human relationships, and pile them together to rebuild new artificial forms of humanity.

I identify the body's subjective constitution, a perspective that invokes remembrances beyond the forbidden, and reveal an epistemological approach to the pain of feeling an agonizing body—the same one that in its materiality is the only unavoidable instance to which the human being is subjected.

Its weight and its skin, its shape and its sensitivity are part of what we are. To visualize his gesture and his potentiality by investigating in his uncertainty, in amnesia and dissatisfaction, an irrevocable reality that gives him back the value he possesses and saves him from oblivion and automation.

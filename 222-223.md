"Vida con Vida" was a performance commissioned by artist Brian Lobel for Cruising for Art: Cruise for Your Own Special Art Experience at Tate Britain for the Queer and Now Exhibition. Vida was five years old at the time. The public performance explored the dynamics between a child and an adult, where the child had control over how the adult was styled. Vida is male but many confused their gender during this performance, which was interesting.

Vida welcomed participants identifiable by colored handkerchiefs. After several performances Vida became more active and would playfully invite adults into their performance. Vida styled participants using clothes and accessories, creating both serious and playful looks. Vida would then photograph them and provide the participants with a Polaroid keepsake. Vida was interviewed for their perspective:

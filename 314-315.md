"…Mud on the ground. Green surroundings. I walk backwards to make Ville follow me. The string connecting myself to Laura brakes. "May I?" "Yes" to Iida.

The string between Ville and myself is about two meters long. I'm walking backwards on top of pile of sawdust and around the space to the bushes, then cut of the part of my shirt where the cords are sewn. My left breast is revealed.

I walk over the pile of sawdust picking a rock the size of both of my fists. I pick a nail from a fruit bag next to the bucket of blueberry bushes. I hammer the fabric connecting the strings between Ville, Jussi and Iida, to a birch tree.

I'm looking at Jussi, Ville and Iida and picking the blueberries at the same time with my left hand. People look quietly. I squeeze the berries in my hand. I squeeze harder, my fingers pumping in a regular beat. I can hear the sound of the squeezing berries…"

Text documentation (extract) by Karoliina Korvuo

"We Will Recover" is a site specific performance where I combined elements from the forest (berries), Korkeaoja's farm (sawdust) and my thoughts and elements at the time. Without a defined one meaning, this performance oscillates around something that hurts, that is important, and that acknowledges that life goes on.

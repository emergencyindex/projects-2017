In March 2017, Radio CAVAret opened Ms. B.'s mailbox for the residency at the Community Learning Laboratories of La Virreina Center de la Imatge. In total, we received eighteen queries online and a few doing phonography in La Virreina and the surrounding areas. Each inquiry was recorded in our voices and corrected as a letter, song, chorus, or sound.

The sentimental office of Elena Francis, a radio program broadcast between 1947 and 1984 in Spain, was for many years a benchmark of behavior for women. A female voice gave instructions about love, sex, and good behavior. The program was written and directed by a man and its content was controlled by the Francoist censorship, which reviewed the scripts, letters, and issues of the office in order to preserve good manners. Miss B is a copy of Miss Francis. She inhabits La Radia, what we call, like futurists, the erotic fluid of the city, waves, and electricity.

The RadiomaniÃ&nbsp;ques write with the sound of our voices the erotic history of the city. Our intention is to warm the walls and soften them, in this case, the Palace of La Virreina and its institution. We also temporarily open a space on the dial. We become characters from the Central to guide the listeners through the live office. Translated by the voices in several languages of Google Translate, Miss B is offering us some tips to make the journey and, also, to have electronic orgasm.

We made a series of three deliveries of the office as a sound tour on the first floor of the Palau de la Virreina building. The public walked within the emission range of a transmitter F.M. The device allowed the participation of a maximum of 30 people who connected through the radios of their mobile devices. For the first broadcast in May, we held a workshop to listen to the consultations with "Las Marujas Ilustradas," a women's reading club who offered us sentimental advice. The first consultation of "La Copito," a sort of ghost and slave of La Virreina, was also issued. The second installment coincided with the celebration of Saint Joan, a special day in Catalonia where bonfires are held to celebrate the summer solstice. This time Radiomaniacs decided to respond to the consultations live, creating a kind of schizophrenic universe where Miss B seemed to incarnate in the body of each. This issue ended with the action of breaking the piÃ±ata in the shape of La Virreina, which contained an edition of postcards of the Copito dietary. In the third and last installment, the listener could follow a procession with the La Virreina's piÃ±ata, while listening to the audio.

Each broadcast and action was different. We could not control the viewer's experience. Elena Francis will be wallowing in the waves and La Virreina will miss her slave.

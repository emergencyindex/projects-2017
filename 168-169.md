EMILY MOCK

I made braised pork belly according to my motherâ€™s descriptions sent over audio messages. Recordings of her audio messages play out loud during the performance. As she talks about ingredients, recipes, my little brother, and my career, I serve the pork belly over rice to the eldest and youngest women, femme, and non-binary people in the audience, followed by everyone else.

妈妈在告诉你 MAMA HAS BEEN TELLING YOU

EMILY MOCK

I made braised pork belly according to my mother's descriptions sent over audio messages. Recordings of her audio messages play out loud during the performance. As she talks about ingredients, recipes, my little brother, and my career, I serve the pork belly over rice to the eldest and youngest women, femme, and non-binary people in the audience, followed by everyone else.

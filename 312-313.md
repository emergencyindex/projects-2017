Through an anarchist act of reflection, â€œBifurcated Radical Anarchist Cultural Enterprise (B.R.A.C.E.),â€ starts with embodying the United States political system through a mirror world of intersectional feminism. Taking the hybridized form of athletics, dance, product design, new media and installation, B.R.A.C.E. seeks to reveal conspiracy and subvert systems that Americans are legally bound to follow but ethically unable to support. Dependent upon subjective perspectives for personal truths, â€œB.R.A.C.E.â€ questions what is reality in a political system that lies and how do we occupy that space?

At IF Museum/Academy, â€œB. R. A. C. E.,â€ a red, green, and blue obstacle course performance-installation parodied the unjust sociopolitical climate of the United States. Referencing Dada, Theater of the Absurd, and Monty Pythonâ€™s â€œSilly Party,â€ â€œB. R. A. C. E.â€ used dance, exercise routines, masks, installation, and altered reality to throw perception into question, creating an absurdist performance about strange politicians.

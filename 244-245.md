"Inevitable Encounter" was presented at the Performance Art Resource Orchestrator in Singapore. Ever since I left Singapore and moved to Taipei in 2016, living in a new environment triggered me to become more conscious of my surroundings. The relationship between urban city, environmental noise, daily life, and human body is interconnected. Our everyday decisions tend to be the result of the various things we see and hear. While living in Taiwan, I realized there is a prevailing sense of insecurity, pessimism, and frustration among many Taiwanese because of various issues such as labor, politics, and air pollution. In fact, these issues are being faced by people in many other cities around the world as well. Perhaps love and peace are the antidote. This performance is a reflection of the social condition which is expressed via the things that I encounter everyday.

The performance itself took reference from my daily routine. Every morning I prepare toasted bread and an egg for breakfast while sounds of busy traffic can be vividly heard. During the performance, traffic noise which I had recorded in my apartment was being played through an amplifier. The world might be filled with issues that haunt us, just like the burnt toast. The eggs symbolized energy and the hammer represented possible negative force. Through the time-consuming act of scraping off the burnt crumbs from the toast with a butter knife and sprinkling it on the eggshell, I sought to dispel all issues away in hope of creating better lives for ourselves.

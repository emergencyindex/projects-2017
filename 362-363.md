MYKITAS EPOCHâ€”ACCLIMATION

In an empty lot in Detroit children clamored with squeals of delight.

â€œPlastic Monster! Plastic Monster! Over here, Plastic Monster!â€

Amongst the throng of children an amorphous white form crept over the grass, clear plastic bottles shimmered like armour over the fluffy white mass of shredded plastic bags.

â€œWhat school subject does this remind you of ?â€â€”an adult

â€œMATH!â€

â€œSpelling! History! English! â€¦ SCIENCE!â€

â€œYes, science and, maybe, recycling? Does it remind you of all the litter on the streets?â€

The creature kept crawling as chatter surrounded it. Suddenly little hands shoved into the mass.

â€œHere, Plastic Monster! More plastic!â€

The creature â€œateâ€ the offerings and slithered over childrenâ€™s feet as it continued moving forwardâ€”both in time and space.

In the US, there are many cities that have high lead levels in the drinking water, but none are more famous than Flint, MI. Thousands of plastic bottles of water sustain this community that is denied this most basic of resources. â€œMykitas Epochâ€”Acclimationâ€ is a site-specific performance that embodied a futuristic fungal creature that had evolved from Michiganâ€™s 40 acre large fungi, Armillaria. It slowly moved through a lot behind the CMAP venue in Detroit collecting plastic for food. This performance is part of the â€œMykitas Epoch Series,â€ a dark, whimsical portrayal of the era after humanity is extinct and all that is left is humanityâ€™s legacyâ€”plastic.

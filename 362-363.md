MYKITAS EPOCH—ACCLIMATION

In an empty lot in Detroit children clamored with squeals of delight.

"Plastic Monster! Plastic Monster! Over here, Plastic Monster!"

Amongst the throng of children an amorphous white form crept over the grass, clear plastic bottles shimmered like armour over the fluffy white mass of shredded plastic bags.

"What school subject does this remind you of ?"—an adult

"MATH!"

"Spelling! History! English! â€¦ SCIENCE!"

"Yes, science and, maybe, recycling? Does it remind you of all the litter on the streets?"

The creature kept crawling as chatter surrounded it. Suddenly little hands shoved into the mass.

"Here, Plastic Monster! More plastic!"

The creature "ate" the offerings and slithered over children's feet as it continued moving forward—both in time and space.

In the US, there are many cities that have high lead levels in the drinking water, but none are more famous than Flint, MI. Thousands of plastic bottles of water sustain this community that is denied this most basic of resources. "Mykitas Epoch—Acclimation" is a site-specific performance that embodied a futuristic fungal creature that had evolved from Michigan's 40 acre large fungi, Armillaria. It slowly moved through a lot behind the CMAP venue in Detroit collecting plastic for food. This performance is part of the "Mykitas Epoch Series," a dark, whimsical portrayal of the era after humanity is extinct and all that is left is humanity's legacy—plastic.

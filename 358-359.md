ÅƒSKI

Blue screen is a post-production technique that allows image manipulation. By using an even, blue background, the camera-recorded action can be transferred to a completely different scenery. In my latest performance, I refer to the cultural history of the color blue, approaching it through the prism of the ancient Greek term pharmakon, meaning medicine, poison, and something that must be sacrificed. I create a series of vertical landscapes, in which a body irradiated by the color, moves between the visible and the imagined. The first and second plan, as well as viewers' fantasies, blend into each other, while identity is negotiated along and across the surface of the screen.

"Pharmakon (it radiates)" is one of the works in the series of monochromatic choreographies-choreographies reduced to, produced by and related to one particular color. It forms a diptych with another performance in blue: "Blue (ribbon dance)."

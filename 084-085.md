In a room bathed in blue light after nightfall there is a reactionary performance of sound and movement: an organic improvisation of an impromptu exploration by two newly acquainted creatives.

CV Peterson's fluffy amorphous trash-being moves in reaction to a steady soundscape that fills the space. The creature, comprised of shredded plastic bags, pulsates and rolls in response to Chatori Shimizu's shō improvisation that is triggered by various pitch changes of his pre-recorded electronic soundscape. A haunting melody resonates through the space, seemingly hypnotizing the bulbous form.

First impressions—organic responses—the introductory moments where one reacts and adapts to new environments.

We would just like to say, "hi."

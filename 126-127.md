MOTHER'S PRIDE

"Mother's Pride" is a durational performance with the following materials:

350 loaves Mother's Pride bread

120L milk

10m red shibari rope

1 mop

5 buckets

"Mother's Pride" is a space which, like the body itself, is autonomous. Evolving over a period of nine hours, it becomes a site of meditation through action. It considers the maternal female within public space. As a mother, I feel much conflict between the label of "mother"—what society perceives that to be, and how I feel as a mother, artist, feminist, etc. The notion of what qualities society thinks makes a "good" mother is problematic, and I wonder how the role is performed on a day to day basis. I am asking myself—where does my performance of the label of mother end and my true embodiment of being a mother begin? Using Mother's Pride bread and milk, which are materials evocative of comfort and happy nuclear families that never really existed, I will reclaim space. I will reclaim my right to define my own borders, my own edges, my own limits, and, ultimately, I will move closer to understanding what these are / where they lie.

I made a baby out of bread,

Moulding its flesh against my own.

Building connections forged through process, through  t i m e.

The bread an extension of my flesh,

The baby an extension of my body,

(of our bodies)

Decomposing [transformational] matter—spread between across surfaces

my flesh a glue

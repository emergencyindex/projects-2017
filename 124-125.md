Two parallel lines of white tape create a running track that ends abruptly at a wall. Next to the wall is a speed radar. Gillian repeatedly runs towards the wall, trying to record ever-higher numbers on the display.

We are exploring personal risk in relation to performance. The faster she runs, the harder the impact, the higher the risk, and the greater the cost.

With each run, we learn more about how Gillian mitigates the risk of pain through technique and through tempering her performance.

Or, perhaps, injury and pain are the costs of success.

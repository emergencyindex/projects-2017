"Widow" is a three-hour solo, movement-based performance-installation that was presented as part of the "Neo-Domesticity Performance Art Festival" at Glasshouse ArtLifeLab, Brooklyn in June 2017. Constrained within a hazy, white room, I embody a woman who struggles for psychic integration in the face of grief. The audience is invited to sit or stand anywhere within the space as I engage in a subtle energetic exchange with each spectator. An ambient, minimalist sound score by composer Chris Becker runs continually throughout the work. It is punctuated at the top of each hour by David Lynch's dark blues song "I Know." This juxtaposition of sound and music merges with an atmosphere of stillness and impeccably controlled movement to create an austere, Kabuki-like visual intensity. Props associated with domesticity hidden within the costume are revealed in a suspenseful manner. Layers of the costume's fabric unravel in radically slow time. Subtexts that hover over the work are: sexual abuse, confinement, the femme fatale, and the lonely wanderer. Though not overtly addressed, these subtexts haunt the piece, transforming the performance space into a symbolic arena for the investigation of the feminine as a declaration of self in the wake of loss.

This participatory project involved eating Babybel cheeses (a product available in both Germany and the USA), crafting sculptures from the red wax coatings, and developing a collection of the sculptures. During this process I held small group discussions about big ideas. This iteration of the project took place at KÃ¼nstlerhaus Lukas Artist Residency in Germany.

The project facilitated interesting discussion on a number of ideas-from cheese, eating, Germany, sculpture, and wax to American politics, international stereotypes, and contemplation of what the Americans would think of these German sculptures, and so on. Communication was challenging at times due to the limiting language barrier. The cheese and sculptures acted as a lovely, silly bridge between us.

I plan on executing another version of this project in America in the near future. We will see how the conversation and sculptures compare.

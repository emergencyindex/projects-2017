"Conditions of Participation" is the first part of my new series of video installations and dance performances. The series pays attention to notions of "the sporting gaze" and historic traditions of sport-related sites and objects. This inquiry is a way to deal with the constructs, rules, and social roles that Western civilization imprints on its members. The implications of the concomitant use of force, hidden or open, has had an effect on the emotional makeup of those subjected to it. The first act of "Conditions of Participation" was created in Athens during the opening of documenta 14 and set in a skateboard park full of tennis balls. While listening to a loop of the manifesto of this year's Documenta, read aloud by curator Adam Szymczyk, the participants performed a long, exhausting, and futile game without any obvious path to winning or scoring a goal.

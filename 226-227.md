"Erosion" was performed in the framework of Zaparturgias, a live art event organized by the NGDO SETEM with the aim of denouncing the violation of human and labor rights suffered by women and men in the footwear and leather industry on a global scale. It also looks at the impacts that this situation has on economically enriched and impoverished countries.

I walk barefoot, shuffling, throughout the space for five hours. Meanwhile, a small rock hangs between my hands.

A progressive wear takes place on the soles of my feet due to friction with the ground.

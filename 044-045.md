LUISHO D&Iacute;AZ

"En/Clave Pop: Villa Alegre" was a performatic intervention held in the city of Villa Alegre for fourteen days, during my artist residence in Social Summer Camp VIII, hosted by Curator&iacute;a Forense.

The piece questioned and reflected on issues related to self-fiction, post-truth and the relativity of the story and history through pop culture.

For two weeks, I presented myself as a foreign pop star who was in the city to shoot a music video. I was introduced to several local actors (neighbors, politicians, etc) who were involved in the production of the video by recommending locations, collaborating with fashion choices and ideas.

The video was shot with the help of two assistants in more than ten locations, and it premiered and showed only once during the presentation of the book _Residencias de Arte Contempor&aacute;neo SOCIAL SUMMER CAMP Villa Alegre, Chile_ in arteBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina (2017).

Parallel to the shooting, every meeting with every person in Villa Alegre was recorded secretly in order to create a second narrative related to the making of the fiction.

"En/Clave Pop: Villa Alegre" is part of a series of performances and interventions, all under the name of "En/Clave Pop," that started on September, 2015.

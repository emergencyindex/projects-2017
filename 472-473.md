FEDERICO LUCAS / PEDRO PLAVAN / MARIANA PORCIÃšNCULA / PABLO MUÃ‘OZ

â€œBÃ¡squetâ€ is a choreographic intervention performed by two dancers wearing training clothes with a basketball. It occurs in the same space and time at which a regular basketball game is happening.

The purpose of â€œBÃ¡squetâ€ is to create a dialogue between dance and sport audiences. I am interested in how we negotiate masculinity. The shared space with another game presents a challenge to forms of spectatorship.

The main score for the performance is the following:

One player is in a demarcated area for a period of five minutes, preferably in the center of the court.

The second player is going to give the basketball to the first player.

The first player will do â€œsculpturesâ€ and movements in periods of 24 seconds, and then the first player has to return the ball.

The second player is outside the area the whole time, witnessing and dialoguing with the first playerâ€™s performance.

The second player has the chance to take the ball from the first player after 24 seconds has passed.

After five minutes they exchange roles.

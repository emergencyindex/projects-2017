"Básquet" is a choreographic intervention performed by two dancers wearing training clothes with a basketball. It occurs in the same space and time at which a regular basketball game is happening.

The purpose of "Básquet" is to create a dialogue between dance and sport audiences. I am interested in how we negotiate masculinity. The shared space with another game presents a challenge to forms of spectatorship.

The main score for the performance is the following:

> One player is in a demarcated area for a period of five minutes, preferably in the center of the court.

> The second player is going to give the basketball to the first player.

> The first player will do "sculptures" and movements in periods of 24 seconds, and then the first player has to return the ball.

> The second player is outside the area the whole time, witnessing and dialoguing with the first player's performance.

> The second player has the chance to take the ball from the first player after 24 seconds has passed.

> After five minutes they exchange roles.

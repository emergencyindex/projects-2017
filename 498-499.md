"We have only just met" was presented in Venice, as a result of the workshop "Considering Time," under the mentorship of Marilyn Arsem, as part of Co-Creation Live Factory—Prologue 1, International Performance Venice Art Week.

We created this work to question the relation between two people. The process involved us tying ourselves together by one wrist and one ankle, and to cover one eye and one ear. We shared meals, a bed, the toilet. We fed each other and attempted to be one body.

Moreover, we went through an additional performance within this 36 hour process. We sat opposite each other, looking at each other's one eye continuously eight hours a day for two days with no intervals, in a cage. The only way of communication was writing on a notepad.

We went through this reciprocal and human journey together to understand how far could you go with a person you've just met? Where does the intensity of a relation start? What is the meaning of getting tied up with someone, to create a rhythm with that person, to see the world from that person's perspective, to become one single body, to trust, to share, to cry&hellip; And to get lost when looking from the other's eye, to forget time.

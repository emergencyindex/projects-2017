â€œFactorsâ€ consisted of repetitive cycles of walking the perimeter of a dark, decrepit room of the abandoned Charukola Institute of Fine Arts building at the University of Dhaka. My body was inches away from the wall. Left arm extended at my waist, I held a small clear glass bowl in my hand which was pressed against the walls. A sharp screeching sound permeated the space as I inched forward. The force I applied to the bowl as it was pressed against the wall tore the paint and plaster off, and resulted in a trail of white dust that accumulated at the base of the wall. The dust was disrupted by impressions of my feet, which also continued to accumulate as I completed circuits.

Every thirty minutes, I would take a glass bowl to the center of the room. There were two bricks and a pile of the remaining bowls positioned there. I knelt on the floor and placed a bowl on top of the brick. I held the other brick with both my hands. I then lifted the brick over my head and proceeded to smash the bowl to bits under the weight of the brick. This was realized with three impacts, delivered at full force. From this, shards of glass were dispersed throughout the space. I would then take another glass bowl, stand at the wall, and begin the cycle again.

This piece was the result of a series of repetitive acts and endurance over an extended interval of time. This speaks to the the bodyâ€™s relationship to space, of inner and outer spaces, and the immediate and expansive. It is evidenced in a starâ€™s birth and death that the end as another place from which to start. The end looks exactly like a beginning because it is.

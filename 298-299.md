"Water is instinct" was a three-hour durational outdoor performance with elements of interactivity happening both in water and at the city beach Ribersborg in Malmö, Sweden. The theme, "Water is instinct, changing everything &hellip; us too," was the artistic point of departure for the group of five artists involved. Each one of us had chosen our own specific interpretation and action around this. Erik Högström was reflecting over the modern man's desire to own nature. He sat out in the water on a chair and took the part as the owner of all water on earth. Johan Haugen focused his senses to the tactile meeting between water and land. He blessed the water and invited the audience to bless the water together with him. Annou Nilson answered the movements of water outside and inside the body and invited meetings with the audience. Andreas M. Larsson let himself be inspired by his childhood living on an island surrounded by water and the contrast of modern man working at the office in constant stress. Felicia Konrad concentrated her communication on water with balance and breathtaking quantum physics. She asked the audience questions like this:

1. How do you imagine that water feels in a plastic bottle?

2. Have you ever been without water more than 24 hours?

3. If you lived under water what kind of creature would you wish to be?

4. What sound that water makes do you love the most?

5. When you say the word WATER out loud, what happens to you?

6. Do you think that the water in the seas and oceans recognizes all the raindrops falling in to it?

7. If you look at the water now, can you see how it is dreaming?

8. Can you sense that you are water?

Around 200 people passed and stayed during our performance. About 20 people stayed the whole time and around 35 most of the time. As one reflects on the experience of this performance, it in some ways felt like a moving meditation full of visions, questions, and strong fluid connections. The vibration of the water really affected us and gave a very strong presence that affected the whole performance. For some moments we were aware of creating in creation and creating together with creation.

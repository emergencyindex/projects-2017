At any given moment, millions of stimuli are processed without our awareness. Our sensory processing occurs at an extremely fast rate, especially when we are constantly bombarded by extreme weather, high volume pitches, and pungent smells. Just as overwhelming, stimuli such as a light breeze, a ruby sunset or the baby blue blanket on the subway filter through. All that is needed to become aware is to slow down our pace. I welcome you to study stillness under the microscope, or what I have started calling it, the â€œSensesoscope.â€

â€œSensesoscopeâ€ is an opportunity to contemplate, to become aware, and to notice. In this project, I embark a journey of time and its relativity. Through a meditative walk that concentrates on heightened sensing I become aware of my surroundings, impulses, desires, common behaviors, and what triggers them. When processing what affects us we comprehend our surroundings and context. I spend mindful time deconstructing the input received, by minimizing output and creating awareness of the vibrational aspect our surroundings; the micro in the macro, and vice versa.

In this performance, I wear a costume made of emergency blankets. This material reflects light and moves in an interesting manner. The blankets respond to stimuli around while I move ever so slowly, catching the subtleties and nuances. I choose to inhibit responses to the stimuli and just contemplate. I self reflect and invite others to reflect as well. I become a useful tool, an active lens that participants can grab onto in order to experience a deep connection with outer sense and inner understanding.

I performed this action for up to twelve hours, from sunrise to sunset, imitating the sunâ€™s path. I realize the underpinnings of my existence in the present moment. I understand the qualities of space, time, and movement. I understand the need of time to pass by quicker to get somewhere. I understand the expectation of both past and future events are most blissful when living in the present without attachments or expectations. I observe in my periphery a choreographed chaos of individuals bumping each other on their life dance, their rhythms and tempos, their expressions and sounds, their needs to say something and communicate.

In the vastness of a time and space, everything makes sense by sensing.

Two spaces in Doha, Qatar and in Richmond, Virginia were created using an agreed-upon formula. Over the course of an hour and through an exchange of written scores we asked each other to complete specific tasks. Processes such as washing our hands, felting and dancing were all utilized throughout the performance based on our shared interests and past works. While we focused on claiming and changing the space through physical interactions, we also assisted each others' wellbeing through tasks such as "ask for a massage" and acknowledged that our audience and the space itself has an affect on our relationship. During moments of rest, when one performer had finished a score, the other one had an opportunity to watch how their score was interpreted. We found playful moments and had a chance to discover new language and movement through these physical conversations.

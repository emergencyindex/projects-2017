During 2017, I developed a project called â€œPerforming with Plants,â€ which consisted of various actions like repeated performances for camera with two trees in Helsinki, two trees in Stockholm, a tree calendar in the Helsinki region, and other experiments. â€œSunday with a Pineâ€ was one of these other experiments.

As an artist-in-residence at the Nida Art Colony on the Curonian Spit in Lithuania, I had been walking up and down the forest slopes with an action camera and posing with various pine trees for a camera on tripod. On my last Sunday, I decided to do one time-lapse video in my usual way, to visit a pine tree up on the dunes with two-hour intervals for a day, 8 am to 8 pm, depending on sunlight, and to write brief blog notes after returning from each session.

These â€œprimaryâ€ performances (the video and the text) were created to be used as material for several â€œsecondaryâ€ performances. Various performers and types of performances were involved in this process: the pine, the sun, the wind and me performing for camera; the blog writing, the screening of the video for various audiences. Perhaps the most interesting performance, in October in Helsinki, consisted of a screening augmented with a live reading. I read the blog notes as a live voice-over to the video, in a double gesture of combining romantic landscape imagery with the prosaic descriptions of a tourist site.

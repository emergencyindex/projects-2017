Beyond its pop culture associations, the Groucho disguise plays a pragmatic role in providing some distance between my actual face and what I see when I look into the mirror of the MacBook screen camera. In "It Might As Well Be Spring," a mash-up duet with musical comedy actress Bernadette Peters, I sit behind two large lilies in a vase singing Irving Berlin's "I Wonder Why," as Peters sings Rodgers and Hammerstein's "It Might As Well Be Spring." My effort to harmonize with Peters was earnest and sincere, and even though I can stay on key, the gap between professional and amateur is clear. Posing as Groucho allows me some comic space as a clown figure, but wearing the headphones contributes an additional line of defense: wherever Peters is during the performance, she is not visible except perhaps in my head, so her aesthetic approval of the collaboration is not an issue. Even as the audience and I experience Peters as a disembodied voice, the connection is intimate, akin to harmonizing with the car radio or singing in the shower. The sound in one's ears eliminates the discontinuities of time and space, as the force of identification with lyrics, voice, melody, beat, and emotional appeal largely mitigates critical judgment.","Then again, the video is an edited recording of a recording so when and how it happened becomes less important then when, where, and how it is viewed. The songs were chosen by me because their lyrics could function as commentaries on the video's effects and premises, and in both cases the power of infatuation is key. Within the narrative arc of these songs, the loss of everyday perspective, the projection of one's happiness or needs onto the outside world, the pleasure of submission to disorientation, passion, and fantasy, all signal the possibility, if not the presence, of a sustainable connection.","Yet it is also possible to see such intoxications of the heart as a delusion, as would be the case with real-world infatuations which are as often not reciprocal, no less consummated. These video performances primarily circulate from my website; they rely on a sympathetic audience of one."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"HER_BELLY_FULL_OF_ICE_.jpg","photo_credit":"Alex Mari","title":"HER BELLY FULL OF ICE","first_performed":"first performed on January 1, 2017","place":"artist's studio in Seattle, WA","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"ALEX MARI","collaborators":[],"home":"Seattle, WA","links":["amberry03.wixsite.com/portfolio"],"contact":"amberry03@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"004-005"},"description":["A trickster, her brown body in a sequined gold prom dress pulled up to her hips, her genitalia partially covered by a hemp loin cloth, hands and face painted white, disorients us by disorienting herself.","I question the complex nature of womxnhood and time, conventionally known as the "biological clock."

My body occupied the space of a missing rock, making use of its now orphan trace. In the distance, I integrated in appearance with other surrounding stones, becoming a rock to the eyes of other visitors. After remaining still for a period of nine hours, my body lost the ability to walk, becoming more rock and less human.","For me, performing "At the Pace of the Rocks" was a means to move beyond visual and material ways of addressing issues of geologic time and new materialism in my practice. The possibility of becoming a rock or trying to feel what a rock feels—or not feel anything at all—seemed very interesting, just as the idea of slowing my pace to the one of geology. From a vital-materialist perspective, Racetrack Playa is a fascinating place. The dolomite rocks move like questioning aliveness, while their mysterious traces reveal the slowness of geological processes and the invisibility of a landscape in continuous transformation. Placing my body within this very specific context seemed to me a very poetic and powerful action, because it generated permeable relationships between the body and the environment. In that precise moment where I am perceived as a rock, or in which my entire body is numb and I have lost the ability to move, every material form operates at a same level; everything seems to collapse, becoming entangled, continuous and non-hierarchical."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"MEDIACRACY.jpg","photo_credit":"Luissa Chekowsky","title":"MEDIACRACY","first_performed":"first performed on January 9, 2017","place":"Theater 54, New York, NY","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"PETER A.

The choral reading of the transcript of that interview, which we called "Mediacracy" and presented on January 9, 2017 at Theatre 54 in New York City as a benefit for ProPublica, was meant to illuminate the conflicts in the ways that media works in our contemporary political climate and the ways that it limits the subjects and perspectives of our discourse. A recording of the performance was subsequently streamed on NowThis News on January 17, 2017. It was viewed by over 350,000 people.","The text was split up amongst twelve female and ethnically diverse performers—it was sometimes read by an individual, sometimes by a small group of three or four, and then occasionally by all twelve in unison. There was no attempt at vocal mimicry, and the chorus members spoke the text clearly and plainly, without much emotional or psychological affect. This created the indelible effect of taking Trump's voice away from him and allowing us to hear his words differently. It also did the same with the voices of the reporters and editors, complicating the easy differentiation of identity and character and making clear that both the form (the media context) and content (Trump's rhetoric) were under the critical microscope for the spectators.","In large part because the voices were female and represented a diversity of ethnicities, there was also a sense of resistance to the text itself, especially when speaking Trump's words from the interview. These were clearly not their voices, but the embodiment of other voices, voices that have been heard and are being heard, being embodied by those who are now even further from being heard and heeded with a Trump administration—those who are not silent and will not be silent, and will not be caught up in another's narrative.

She's desperate to endear herself and brings her A-game. Things start slow with the offer of sub-par snacks (slightly stale popcorn and Russian hard candy) in a container that's not service quality, the best she could do without notice. The food potently communicates a type of commitment as well as desperation and possibly lack of savvy.","Then, Woman expediently trims a large excess of pubic hair with a beard trimmer that materializes suddenly. It's delightfully ridiculous but aware that ritualistic/public cutting of hair, especially women's, is a dense subject. It also echoes of any sickening self-mutilation that women (are expected to) (unwillfully) endure to meet prevailing beauty norms.","Woman segues into a series of unseemly jokes about rape kits. These observations are wildly ironic but intentionally not funny. The anti-humor creates palpable discomfort.

While making the sculpture as well as the act of placing the bones qualify as performances in the traditional sense, I would like to insist that both only enabled what I consider to be the central act of performance here: the bones interacting with the landscape. By publicizing the coordinates of the durational performance event, I summoned an audience that could watch the installation and its performance at different stages. The last postcard of the year came with a clay bone that receivers are asked to place somewhere themselves, and watch it dissolve. Everyone is encouraged to create their personal performance ritual. The number of final bones was limited to 250.","It was of particular significance to me that the objects were bones and thus traditional symbols of memory and monuments. However, it was also important that they were not recognizable as human bones, rather as bone-shaped sculptures that link life and death in a wider context, allowing for multiple connections to time, a performance of nature and the art of letting go. In the current setting of the environmental crisis, I felt that a conscious observation of the rhythm of natural forces and a shift away from human action was a first step in growing a connection to our surroundings.

A Future Host speculates with indifference to their origins in historical trauma, creating new conditions of social gathering to give presence to Future Hosts who stumble into the hostile present via an involuntary inheritance of the past.",""Future Host: A Speech Opera" marks the first declaration of Future Host at work in the theater. Straddled between the sensible here, the unbearable now, and a future that never was, "Future Host" transforms the dialectics of language and politics into a vulnerable operation that is as disembodied as it is visceral. Absent of actors, the performance features a multichannel spatial sound installation with live improvisational music by a Chinese American children's string quartet, where the audience roams freely in open, emptied space.","Reviving the ancient, pre-individuation figure of the chorus, Tingying Ma's original performance text channels historical methods and patterns of individual and collective speech-making. Nineteen non-professional Chinese voice actors, each embodying an anonymous chorus, speak in a succession of dialogue, unison, to simultaneous monologue with heightened awareness of but little regard for semantic authority. Fragmented chants, non-sequitur slogans, cynical wisdom, political dogmas and twenty-first century retail ideologies—instantly recognizable to contemporary Chinese speakers yet prankishly impenetrable—form a landscape of linguistic failures, as words race after their business of self-actualization and self-annihilation. In this extended speech act, the dialectics of the singular and plural, private and public, the us and the other, in assembly or dispersal, is transformed into a fully sensorial, affective present—one defined by the irreducibility of human timber.","Premiered on January 20, 2017, "Future Host" seized upon the coincidence with Trump's inauguration to make an alternative claim to the theater vis-Ã&nbsp;-vis the catastrophic monumentality of political spectacle.",""Future Host" engaged the audience in an exercise of listening and public gathering—between fraught histories and the possibilities of other futures—hence engendering a new form of community and political imagination."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"PyramidsTheme.jpg","photo_credit":"Llaboratory Co","title":"PYRAMIDSTHEME","first_performed":"first performed on January 21, 2017","place":"OperaCabal, Chicago, IL","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"LLABORATORY CO","collaborators":["(Marco Rosichelli / Ryan Peter Miller)"],"home":"Kansas City, MO / Chicago, IL","links":["rosichelli.com"],"contact":"marcorosichelli@gmail.com / ryanpetermiller@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"032-033"},"description":["Taking the transparent form of a pyramid scheme, the homophonic "PyramidsTheme" performance invites viewers to invest in a regenerative drawing project allowing participants to buy and/or create original works of art to be resold to friends and family.

Rachel Parry conceived GAL so non-conforming artists could come together. A Safe Space for the Intersectional and Neurodivergent where otherness and identity is celebrated. A different approach was needed. Members are holistically supported to freely explore lines of inquiry inside their practice or to just exist alongside everyone; to breathe with or without labels in order to thrive as artists. Initially led by Rachel Parry and Annette Foster, a cooperative style was encouraged at HOWL. Knowledge, skill-sharing and positive feedback sessions were paramount to nurture and honor the whole person and build in resilience for each artist while learning performance semantics. Processes used were nothing new (Heuristic, Jin Shin Jyutsu, Trans-personal Psychology, Butoh, Contact Improvisation). We drew on the experiences of those who attended and became centred on our own Awkward Displacements. We group-choreographed micro-actions arising from our own self-soothing and idiosyncratic impulses: _Right hand clasping then rubbing shoulders. Winding hair. Palm on face. Tapping. Interlacing fingers. Shallow breathing. Swaying. Going to ground_.","LiveArt pieces also emerged from each artist incorporating Movement, Dance, Noise, Projections, and Impermanent Installations. We used base materials to ground ourselves: WOOD, PAPER, METAL, AIR, WATER, EARTH, MEMORIES, LOVE, COAL, DOUGH, ELECTRICITY, BLOOD, TIME. And we developed a mantra to guide our work: MAKE, REPEAT, LOOP, EDIT, KEEP, ADAPT, DESTROY. We combined everything, forming a Durational, Post-Fluxus, Dada, En-mass Happening. Semi-scored and conducted by Rachel Parry while artists self-curated an auto ethnographic journey through learned aural signifiers and Noetic Balancing.","After Meditative Grounding Activities to center and unite the Collective, we  dispersed, mapping the white gallery into personal sacred spaces to inhabit. Artists freely moved between spaces, amassing personal energy before interacting with or alongside others. They could break and transition to audience. Or signal to leave if feeling overwhelmed. Equally, spectators were invited to be amongst us and encounter our techniques. Remnants and residues were worked on by all unless ritually signified as "revered objects." We continually transformed and distorted. Installation(s) viewed as singular or unabridged, with or without associated bodies.","Our Awkward Displacements anthropomorphised over two days. Safely excorcising inner-self into actions and objects, which We transmuted via a visual archeology of our lived bodies. Blank gallery space oversaturated into something else.

OUST Project was conducted before and after the end of South Korean former leader Park Geun-hye's presidency.","Park Geun-hye and the Choi Soon-sil Gate scandal involved the influence of Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of shaman-esque cult leader Choi Tae-min, over President Park Geun-hye. Widespread coverage of this South Korean political scandal began in late October 2016. On December 21, a Special Prosecution Team began to investigate the Park-Choi Gate scandal. On March 10, 2017, The Constitutional Court of Korea ruled to uphold the impeachment of President Park Geun-Hye. All eight judges agreed that Park abused her power as a president.","OUST Project started since the end of 2016 when the scandal was spotlighted by the global news media. As an artist-activist, I worked to educate myself and others on the power of law, democracy, and the public's voice through performances, paintings, installations, and graphic designs. Using protest banner board as a medium, I printed a quote: "Oust, President Park Geun-hye" one side and "ë°•ê·¼í˜œ í‡´ì§„" in Korean on the other. As it was an actual phrase used by many protestors in South Korea at that time, I re-presented both South Korea's contemporary demonstration culture and Korean public voices in the United States of America. South Korea was mainly known for Korean pop music and soap opera culture among American and non-Korean communities. But, since the Korean artist blacklists created by the Park regime were revealed, I (then as an AIC student) felt the urgency of educating people out of the indifference and ignorance of their and another country's sociopolitical issues.","The OUST Project was performed throughout the City of Chicago. I performed in front of the Harris Theater, at the "Inspired Korea in Chicago," an event organized by the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea and Korean Cultural Center of Chicago in December 2016. Here, I was called by old Korean ladies the "follower of North Korea ë¹¨ê°±ì´," a word commonly used by the Korean conservatives to devalue the liberal supporters of South Korea, and Chicago Police officers inspected my surroundings for potential danger. Although I performed numerously in front of different AIC buildings, not a single Korean student participated the performance, but rather remained silent."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"ENCLAVE_POP_-_VILLA_ALEGRE.jpg","photo_credit":"Valeria Pertovt","title":"ENCLAVE POP—VILLA ALEGRE","first_performed":"first performed on February 1, 2017","place":"Public spaces in Villa Alegre, Chile","times_performed":"performed once for 7 days in 2017","contributor":"LUISHO DÃAZ","collaborators":["Diego Poblete","Valeria Pertovt"],"home":"Montevideo, Uruguay","links":[],"contact":"luisho.diaz@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"044-045"},"description":["ENCLAVE POP—VILLA ALEGRE",""En/Clave Pop: Villa Alegre" was a performatic intervention held in the city of Villa Alegre for fourteen days, during my artist residence in Social Summer Camp VIII, hosted by CuratorÃ­a Forense.","The piece questioned and reflected on issues related to self-fiction, post-truth and the relativity of the story and history through pop culture.","For two weeks, I presented myself as a foreign pop star who was in the city to shoot a music video.

We particularly sought to include groups left out of dominant stories about the community: non-white people, people with progressive politics, students, migrant workers, LGBTQIA individuals, and a host of cultural others. All participating groups conducted research and made costumes, banners, and puppets according to their own interests and abilities.","The day of the parade, children from a hispanic mobile home community, wearing funny hats representing their favorite foods, mixed with teenagers in capes designed to express their queer superpowers. They mixed with seniors, who carried images of loved ones buried in the historically black section of the town cemetery, and they mixed with university students in costumes representing local mountain ranges. It was boisterous, fun, and deeply accepting.","To our surprise, the capacity of our parade for convivial connection, spontaneous performance, and self-representation grew rather than diminished when the event was forced indoors because of rain. As its form evolved from a parade into a happening, HCSP became a more pointed exercise in community self-seeing.","Moments of party gave way to moments of procession. Groups promenaded their costume creations for each other on a makeshift runway. Music and dance intended for the parade route became focal performances, and a potluck, planned for after the event, became a central feature of the project as an expression of community sharing.HCSP was given a open, responsive structure designed to authorize participants to shape the project's content. This same structure also allowed for the project to shift form as the situation required.","When we began, we could not predict what we would create together. This is the magic of the project.

The lighting was five pools of light along a diagonal that appeared and disappeared in relation to my movement, creating a streaming flow of light spheres. The dancing was inspired by images from the SRT classes, specifically from the introductory- level class seven. The sound was sitar, an instrument I closely associated with Bob, and the costume was clothing I got while in Istanbul the previous summer, training to become a teacher of Skinner Releasing.","To create the specific directions and motions, I also used a dandelion globe that dancer Vasiliki Tsagkari and I caught from a sunbeam while dancing together.

The second installment coincided with the celebration of Saint Joan, a special day in Catalonia where bonfires are held to celebrate the summer solstice. This time Radiomaniacs decided to respond to the consultations live, creating a kind of schizophrenic universe where Miss B seemed to incarnate in the body of each. This issue ended with the action of breaking the piÃ±ata in the shape of La Virreina, which contained an edition of postcards of the Copito dietary. In the third and last installment, the listener could follow a procession with the La Virreina's piÃ±ata, while listening to the audio.","Each broadcast and action was different. We could not control the viewer's experience. Elena Francis will be wallowing in the waves and La Virreina will miss her slave."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"Tierra_La_Constitucion_Ha_Muerto.png","photo_credit":"Grant Leuning","title":"TIERRA Y LIBERTAD: LA CONSTITUCIÃ“N HA MUERTO","first_performed":"first performed on February 5, 2017","place":"Palacio de Bellas Artes, El ZÃ³calo, La Casa de El Hijo del Ahuizote and more in Mexico City, Mexico","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"EL COMITÃ‰ MAGONISTA TIERRA Y LIBERTAD","collaborators":["Grant Leuning","Pepe Rojo","Jhonnatan Curiel","Alfredo GonzÃ¡lez Reynoso","Eduardo Araiza","Maria CerdÃ¡ Acebron","Eunice Adorno","Daril Fortis","Adalberto Charvel PÃ©rez and many more"],"home":"San Diego, CA / Tijuana, Mexico / Mexico City, Mexico","links":["tierraylibertad.xyz"],"contact":"gleuning@ucsd.edu / rojopepe@hotmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"060-061"},"description":["On February 5, 1903, the staff of the radical newspaper _Regeneracion_ hung a banner between their windows reading "La Constitucion Ha Muerto," and posed for a photograph.

My original idea was to make a dance about the music deployed in the CIA and US military torture programs. I was interested in the similarities between "enhanced interrogation techniques" and performance techniques, especially in terms of minimalism—repetition, endlessness, obsession, release—and how these strategies bend and inflate time. However, making a piece about torture is incredibly distressing. By creating this piece, was I somehow perpetuating torture? Was I benefiting from it? In despair, I abandoned the idea and channeled theater shaman AndrÃ© Gregory from his 1981 film _My Dinner with AndrÃ©_, creating a new version of the famed two-hour dinner conversation while seeking answers on how to make a dance about torture, examining what it could have been and my own fear of making it. The performance emerges as an amalgam of fragments: fractures of complicity, futility, and desire.","In this work, familiar narratives are subverted: structural, visual, emotional, and physical elements are stolen from iconic films, pop songs, and various forms of choreography. I cannibalize my source materials, turn them into choreographic tools, and claim them for myself. In "My Dinner with Andrea: The Piece Formerly Known as Torture Playlist," repetition and circling and taffy-pulled timing infiltrate a conversation, a music-video-style dance, a trio dance, and the larger meta-structure of the piece. Two musicians play "Rawhide" on coconuts and saxophone in the theater lobby. A dancer performs a sexy, high-heels solo to an endless loop of "Call Me Maybe" until she finally collapses. The performance space is reset for a re-creation of the movie _My Dinner with AndrÃ©_—a dinner table for two, a pianist playing a loop of Satie and slowly eliminating notes until he is left with only two.","The bulk of the piece is a conversation between the artists Andrea Kleine and Anya Liftig examining how torture has infected their lives, how it exists in everything from pop tune refrains to what they are eating to their personal histories and to the very art they are making. The piece disintegrates into to dance. It resurrects itself. It refuses to go away. It has no choice but to begin again."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"Bamboo_Mustard_edited.jpg","photo_credit":"Monica Alcazar Duarte","title":"BAMBOO MUSTARD","first_performed":"first performed on February 10, 2017","place":"Studio Theatre, Central Saint Martins, London, UK","times_performed":"performed fifteen times in 2017","contributor":"ADAM PAROUSSOS","collaborators":[],"home":"London, UK","links":["facebook.com/bamboomustard / soundcloud.com/bamboo-mustard"],"contact":"adam_mk25@hotmail.co.uk","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"064-065"},"description":[""Bamboo Mustard" was initially created as an anti-consumerist response to the pollution of London's environment and politics. The performance has developed over the year and has drawn upon different themes such as alter-ego identities, communal creativity, autumn, and hierarchical structures. This performance involves experimental self-made instruments and communal music-making led by an entity of noise: Bamboo Mustard. Half instrument, half human, Bamboo Mustard is an embodiment of raw and primal audio energy dressed in bamboo cane trousers, a conker collar and a grass mask. Raw natural material and scrap has been scavenged and reconstructed to turn detritus into sound-objects for spontaneous music-making. These include a collection of chordophone (string) instruments, two of which are made out of TV aerials, a tree branch instrument and smaller percussive- and wind-instruments. As Bamboo Mustard, I journey through each instrument and object, building different sound textures through improvisation and body movement. Recently the performances draw inspiration from the sounds of autumn (such as dry leaves and conkers) bringing a natural soundscape to an inside space. Bamboo Mustard communicates only through sound as his speaking voice is robbed by a small radio mouthpiece, which distorts the frequencies and opinions from various radio stations. Bamboo Mustard slowly invites audience members to join in and play the instruments themselves and allows the remainder of the performance to be open-ended and unpredictable. On occasion, Bamboo Mustard disposes of the alter-ego identity and transfers the costume to audience members, and the music making is left in their hands. The aim of these performances is to create a sense of communal non-hierarchical music-making, embracing spontaneity and creativity of the present moment. Scrap repurposed into instruments suggests that anything can be turned into an object and mediator of positive and creative energy. It also helps remove the cultural and traditional baggage surrounded by conventional instruments, so audience members don't feel intimidated to play and join in. With the idea that everything and everyone has a vibration and energy, the performance aims to tap into this phenomenon and embrace a collective expression through objects and ourselves, yet also embraces the failure of these aims.

The three-hour piece places viewers and performer in an unfamiliar and rigorously defined social logic that disorients them while inspiring curiosity to learn what precisely is going on. Two charts on the floor are composed of white gaffer's tape with white, laser-cut, wooden symbols and are used for collecting data from the audience. Against one wall is a chair with a silver stopwatch and a custom-printed notebook for recording the data. Across from the chair is a pedestal with a stack of note cards featuring instructions on how to speak. I mark viewers' feet with gaffer's tape and time how long the marked foot stays in place on the floor. I then use that time measurement to perform a calculation that helps select a single instruction card describing how to speak.","The second chart has a chair with a chalk line tool attached to it and a tape measure. When a visitor enters this space, I mark their foot position on the floor. I then extend the chalk line tool to make a white line from the center of the chair, through the chart, to the tape mark. I then take three measurements marked by intersections of the chalk line and the grid lines of the chart.

People were invited to try each of them; there was a card on the tray explaining its purpose, and I was able to then discuss the idea that a food could be a sexual motivator. The aphrodisiacs were sliced cucumber with a "Good & Plenty" licorice on top. In a study that looked at how different smells stimulate sexual arousal, these foods are said to increase blood flow to the vagina: asparagus, with folic acid, boosts histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm; celery contains two chemicals, androsterone and androstenol, which serve as sexual attractants when ingested.

In a large parking lot at the edge of Balboa Park (known by the initiated as "The Fruit Loop"), twenty parked, unlocked cars played a different story on their sound system. In the dark of the night, 250 visitors hopped in and out of the cars, listening to tales of brushing shoulders with strangers while experiencing it in real time. Sometimes you would sit in an empty car only to smell it's former occupant.","Many of the people who practiced the art of cruising didn't survive it, and accounts of those lost to the AIDS crisis gained special resonance while hearing their bodiless voices ruminating in the night.

As a result, my performance created distinctive auditory artifacts that transformed its characteristics according to the position of the listener. I have referred to these physical phenomena as spatial resonances in moirÃ© patterns, generated by sound wave interference."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"CONVERSATION_VIA_SCORES.jpg","photo_credit":"Bridget Manown / Matt Spahr","title":"CONVERSATION VIA SCORES","first_performed":"first performed on March 15, 2017","place":"VCUarts Qatar Gallery, Doha, Qatar / Depot Building, Richmond, VA","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"NATASHA KOVACS / LINDSAY PARNELL","collaborators":[],"home":"Richmond, VA","links":["nk-lp.com"],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"090-091"},"description":["Two spaces in Doha, Qatar and in Richmond, Virginia were created using an agreed-upon formula.

Inspired by Virginia Woolf's _Orlando_, the performance examines the fluid boundaries of gender, and the notion that we each, as individuals, contain multitudes. Told from the point of view of five characters who had known Carlett at different stages of her transformation from a naval crewman to a female cover model, the story circles around the gap left after her disappearance.","Born Charles Robert Brown in Pittsburgh around 1927 and raised as a man, she joined the Navy in 1950 in order to receive treatment for what was later understood to be the condition of being intersex—having both male and female sexual characteristics. She declined the Navy's offer to remove the female sexual organs and remain a man, choosing instead to leave military service and live as a woman. She was photographed for the cover of _Jet Magazine_, where she announced her intention to travel to Denmark to have gender affirmation surgery, as it was not available in the United States; and to marry her boyfriend, an army sergeant. If successful, she would have been the first African-American to undergo such surgery. No records of her whereabouts exist after 1953.","Beyond the trajectory of this one life, there is a largely untold story of countless people who have been born intersex in every society, at every point in history. In the 1950s, the United States simmered with systemic inequity and racial injustice. Fluidity of gender was barely mentioned in medical records of the time, while being as frequent of an occurrence as it is today. This is an attempt to fill in gaps, to describe through one person the many instances of individuals navigating a society in which they are utterly invisible."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"X_stasis.png","photo_credit":"Jamie James","title":"X~STASIS","first_performed":"first performed on March 17, 2017","place":"107 Projects, Sydney, Australia","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"AÃ‘A WOJAK","collaborators":[],"home":"Lismore, New South Wales, Australia","links":["lovelettersincerely.wordpress.com"],"contact":"anawojak@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"096-097"},"description":["This performance was presented during a two day program curated around the theme of Ecstasy.

Therefore, "Sun.Sync" explores the transformation of the human being surrounded by materialism and overconsumption. The pollutants and the plastic materials that I interact with in the performance are metaphors of the large-scale planetary perturbations caused by unsustainable human desire. I investigate and manipulate the natural resources within the installation as a way to symbolize the sacred relationship between people and nature, evoking a quest for the sublime where infinite attention to the environment's complexity is sought from the observer. "Sun.Sync" reveals an intricate network of sacred connections, where sunlight projections and digital installations enhance the feeling of nature's presence.","The video integrates mapping technology to create a unique experience that immerses the audience in the disconcerting aesthetic reciprocity between natural and digital life.

We become isolated when we are out of physical reach of each other.

A fusion of these experiences with my interest in 1990s pop psychology and the tropes of the emergence of life coach culture developed into a performance for video as well as a live performance.","For this project, I performed a life coach presentation on stage, implementing the venue house lights and smoke machines that emit a dense vapor as dramatic elements to the life coach's stage delivery.

The audio for the performance was purposely recorded, practiced, and studied, and then lip-synched on stage to the audio track for video recording. The intention of this strategy was to create a distancing device that creates a tension between sincere, convincing content and calculated, theatrical, fixed strategies. The end result is a promotional video displayed on a big screen television (circa 1992) staged at The Art Museum, University of Toronto. In addition to the video performance, I was present for the duration of the exhibition to promote the video and to engage with the audience in a "theater of therapies".","The success of this work lies in an intended blurred line between the authentic and the satirical.

These audio/visual constraints were utilized to remove the possibility of a response to the other's cues creating a kind of isolation chamber contained within our own practice. We also rigged up a Chladni plate that responded to their frequencies. And, for my part, I visually projected, via digital microscope, a "live" animation for the audience. I dropped a variety of salt crystals onto the metal plate, and—unlike typical Chladni symmetrical shape formations—the salts moved gradually, skipping and gathering at intervals. The visual effect was more reminiscent of a stop-motion animation captured in a low frame rate rather than a uniform pattern. I tossed a few dead honeybees onto the plate as a kind of nod to a short film Melissa Grey and I had previously collaborated on. The film explored "The Telling of the Bees," an early folktale about meaningful communication and mourning rituals between humans and honeybees. When the bees touched the plate they jumped, flipped forward, as if they were doing continuous somersaults in an anti-gravitational field. We called this performance a live animation. But this was vastly different from, say, those first animal locomotion studies by Eadweard Muybridge, which relied on the persistence of vision to create the illusion of movement historically marking the beginning of the moving image or cinema as we know it. This "live" animation was made in a single take, a magnification without use of a camera or spaces between frames. This was something different. To call this sonic animism or sonic agency gets closer to a movement derived and mediated through random frequencies—I'm still looking for the correct description of this performance.

Taking these words to heart, I used one wall of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago's _MFA Show 2017_ to put up four paintings by my great-grandmother Esther Rogatnick (1895—1983).","An amateur painter who never showed her work publicly before, Grandma Esther was included in the exhibition's press materials alongside other 2017 graduates. A wall label indicated her name, titles, and materials: The four works were untitled and undated. They may have had titles, I don't know, and they were each made at a specific time. Next to them in the gallery was a separately labeled video monitor, upon which played images of the sequoia cut in Muir Woods in _Vertigo_ (1958), _La JetÃ©e_ (1962), _Sans Soleil_ (1983), _12 Monkeys_ (1995), and new images recorded by filmmaker Sam Ellison in 2017.

In this performance, I explored the ancient Ayurvedic practice of oil pulling as a tool for art-making. Oil pulling is used as a homeopathic method for detoxification. It is performed by swishing a spoonful of oil in one's mouth for up to twenty minutes and then spitting out the oil. It is believed that fat-soluble toxins are pulled from the mouth and bind to the oil. Toxins enter your body purportedly as the result of unhealthy lifestyle choices (i.e. smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine, eating processed foods, performing black magic, etc.).","At the start of this performance, I emerged dressed as my performance persona "Dead Art Star." For the first action, I swished walnut oil in my mouth as I stretched on a yoga mat made of canvas. Meanwhile, Youtube tutorials on oil pulling and portrait painting, as well as an episode of Bob Ross's _The Joy of Painting_, could be heard playing simultaneously in the background from a laptop, resulting in an audio collage of instructional words and phrases layered on top of each other. As the performance progressed, I collected my spit into a small cup. After stretching, I proceeded to use the toxin-filled oil as a medium for oil painting. Aided with a mirror that doubled as a palette, I painted a self-portrait of "Dead Art Star" on the canvas mat with oil paint and the walnut oil/spit solution. At the end of the performance, I hung the portrait on the wall for display and undressed, separating my own body from the painted portrait double.","The object produced with this material operates as a stand-in for the artist, made of the artist's own DNA. The resulting piece documents a process where the artist's body is cleansed and recreated. The artist's alter ego is metaphorically exorcised from the artist's body and given physical form. The artist has delivered himself from his own evil, honoring his body as a temple.

Structured as a ritual initiation, the performance took audiences on a journey through six different buildings and into a deeper part of themselves and their community. Six audience members, referred to as "boners," were admitted every ten minutes. The entry was at Tacos Mariachi, a local restaurant and the meeting address listed for the performance. Then, the audience was given an entry gesture and the address to the first site down the street. The door was locked and the gesture was presented to gain entrance. Inside, the boners were asked to pick a question they would want answered by their journey from twenty-four listed on a board. In the next room, a diviner asked the boner to whisper their question and throw bones onto a map of symbols, which represented the performance venues and informed how to navigate their journey. Then they went to a room of video and audio installations addressing birth, death, transition, and infinity. This then led to a room of Tan, a beautiful creature of anxiety, tension, seduction, and confusion. Following, the journey led outdoors to meet a calm and organic Kei, a woman offering a stone and directions to the next site. Down the street they went to an abandoned garage and were interrogated for authenticity by Agent Zay, who weighed their stone, a symbol for the soul. If the boners were inauthentic, they were remediated by nearby Cadmus who administered a reality test. They walked down the street to a large industrial building for psychological questioning by Que, drawing out metaphysical concerns. Nearby, Bung, a dominatrix, probed for emotional authenticity. If deemed inauthentic, they would not pass. At a distance in the large building was Rem, comforting and welcoming. Painted on the floor was a labyrinth of life symbols with the boners tracing a pathway, encouraged and assisted. Here, their stone was washed. Back to the streets, they headed to a distant building and to Zun, who offered medicinal brews and messages for a life to live. Tracing a pathway through the streets encountering guides and advice along the way, they reached the last building and a meditative wash of song and dance, like Shiva, the world was created anew. They went down the hall and into a room of darkness with Vig, who reminded the boners of hearing and being. The lights went up and they could observe a teeming of worms in rich earth. Through a chamber and out the garage door headed to an insulated storage building, they went to a place where life force is stored and accessed. Sabu demonstrates the life force, the living energy. Then they went to the last room where they met Urd. In a long high chamber of gauze and shadows, boners were invited to sit cross legged at a long old table. They were there to add a knot and tie their stone to an ever-expanding web of material. The performance ended with each boner brought to a photographer, their re-birth documented and offered as a marker."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"å¦å¦å¨åè¯ä½ _Mama_has_been_telling_you.png","photo_credit":"Teddy Wolff","title":"å¦ˆå¦ˆåœ¨å‘Šè¯‰ä½&nbsp;","first_performed":"MAMA HAS BEEN TELLING YOU","place":"","times_performed":"first performed on May 11, 2017","contributor":"Wing on Wo & Co., New York, NY","collaborators":["EMILY MOCK"],"home":"Brooklyn, NY","links":["emilymock.org"],"contact":"emilymock@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"168-169"},"description":["å¦ˆå¦ˆåœ¨å‘Šè¯‰ä½&nbsp; MAMA HAS BEEN TELLING YOU","EMILY MOCK","I made braised pork belly according to my mother's descriptions sent over audio messages.

Ballard's novel _Crash_ (a pornographic novel about technology), car pop culture, and by the performance artist/activist Guillermo Gomez-Pena.","Influenced by a recent trip to Vancouver, Canada, which I experienced as a car-dominated city, I wanted to question Western technology habits and our unsustainable car industry. In a sense, my critique of our car culture can be seen as a metaphor for the larger, human-made climate crisis. As one of the most urgent problems of our time, like many other artists, I find it immensely important to engage with it. I chose to focus on our relationship with cars is one way into the complex eco-critical territory. It is a way to process how to deal with difficult questions of human responsibility.","Despite the serious subject matter, I was eager for "If In Doubt, Don't" to be devised in a playful, satirical, and inquisitive manner. In an attempt to avoid being blatantly didactic, I wanted to bring the perplexing issues to life and make them more meaningful by using sensuousness to appeal to people's feelings and sensitivity. These considerations led to the decision to make it for an audience of one. As a result, we (six performers) ended up being placed in and around a car in a garage throughout the performance. One audience member at a time was invited to join us in this limited enclosed space where our self-invented therapy took place. Here, distinctive smells, live musical soundscapes, intimate spoken-word scenarios, and voluptuous, tactile sculpture costumes embraced audiences for a full-on sensory experience.","Excerpts from therapeutic DIY mantras repeated during the performance:","— The car is not my mother","— The car is not my father","— It is not my lover","— The car is here","— I let go","— The car is not my toy","— I used to desire to become one with the car—but I never really owned it and it never owned me"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"Mi(No)Boda_edited_edited.jpg","photo_credit":"Alejandra AlarcÃ³n / Beatriz MillÃ³n","title":"MI (NO)BODA","first_performed":"first performed on May 24, 2017","place":"Calle arturo IbaÃ±ez, CoyoacÃ¡n, Mexico City, Mexico","times_performed":"performed twice in 2017","contributor":"CLARA M.

That dress would soon confront me with a personal trauma.","I had tried to provoke a wedding with the man with whom she had shared ten years of her life, a relationship that was disintegrating without anyone being able to remedy it.

She understood that if I wanted to advance in my life, I had to make that frustrated wedding. That "consecration of love" that could have been and never was and never would be— unless it was through a (not) symbolic wedding, an act that could only be artistic, poetic, magical, and also playful. Yes, above all, playful! There is nothing more cathartic, more wonderfully liberating, than humor.","A society that aspires to be more conscious of itself, more coherent and, ultimately, more mature, needs to work with the imaginary that underlies the collective unconscious.

Founded on the evidence that our society is increasingly exhausting and exhausted (physically, thematically, spiritually, environmentally, etc.) and trapped in a ghostly wheel, this allegorical space is conceived as a sanatorium inspired by a Roman bathhouse. It represents an act of negation towards the narratives of progress—settled on incessant acceleration and accumulation—and presents inaction as both an image of resistance and resignation, as if a hangover caused by an accumulation of layers over the centuries has ultimately generated a passive entity, restless but unable to move.

Three of the four towels are placed on the massage table, one as a base for the body, and two as a comfortable pillow for the head. The volunteers will use the remaining towel to cover my body.

By subjecting my body, the female and immigrant body, to a demanding but serene and beautiful confinement, I want to convey strength, commemorate those who suffer, and promote harmony.

There we developed the Maybe Museum's first tour, focused on intangible heritage. Portugal has two traditions on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage List, and one of these is the Cante Alentejano, which stems from the region Atalaia is in. We wanted to explore the limits of the museum format through playing with how the form of polyphonic singing could become both the form and content of a museum.","The Maybe Museum is a live, performed museum that responds to the archaic format of museum presentation. Rather than existing within the framework of four walls, owned objects, and chronological knowledge, the Maybe Museum combines fictional realities with factual possibilities and engages with how museums are imagined and experienced.","The performance, "Aljustrel: From Mine to Mind" was a 60-minute walk through Aljustrel. Based on the town's odd mixture of mining wealth and declining choral tradition, the performance was presented as part of the Maybe Museum. Led by six characters over three chapters, we took an audience of 20 through an entangled narrative of local folklore, tourist sight lines, and regional histories. It featured an unveiling of a public statue that had hitherto not been covered up, a choreographed water drawing on a hillside car park, and the collective reconstruction of a regional myth inside a bullring.","For us, the challenge of developing a performance across multiple languages and layers of fiction (the Maybe Museum, its exhibition, and its characters) made two things visible. As a collaborative duo, we understood the kernel of our work differently, and this fundamental difference was where our work's fluid meaning might best be produced. On one hand, our work was about obfuscating narratives into an experience that thwarted comprehension of a story, as well as responding to the linearity of institutional stories with something more ambiguous but nonetheless still comprehensible as composite parts. This tension generated the substance of "Aljustrel: From Mine to Mind"—manifesting in the character's schizophrenic truths, contradicting approaches to addressing the audience, and how the Museum was at once a feasible format and an entirely absurd proposition. The question of what should be communicated, and how, flooded over from our engagement with the concept of museums into our disparate approaches to devising the performance, and into the performance itself."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"PETRICHOR_OR_HOW_THE_WORLD_SMELLS_AFTER_IT_RAINS.jpg","photo_credit":"Chantal RodrÃ­guez and Aleha Solano","title":"PETRICHOR OR HOW THE WORLD","first_performed":"SMELLS AFTER IT RAINS","place":"","times_performed":"first performed on July 1, 2017","contributor":"Wild Goose Creative, Columbus, OH","collaborators":["ALEHA SOLANO"],"home":"Columbus, Ohio","links":["facebook.com/ephemeralperformanceartensemble"],"contact":"alehasolano@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"230-231"},"description":[" \nSMELLS AFTER IT RAINS","ALEHA SOLANO","An unknown character portrait reasons for discontent and rejection, the ruptures of self-love tinged with anguish and loneliness.

It lasted two hours.","The concept of vitality was borrowed from the manifesto of the Metabolists (a Japanese modernist group).",""We regard human society as a vital process â€¦.

It was related to the period that I recognized as the most vital, late childhood, and was related to my personal experience. The group of performers were invited to create the repetition of a nibbling gesture and at the same time incorporate their own gestures (ensuing from different cultural and social contexts). The wide range of abstract gestures initiated by performers, e.g. highlighting a hand, killing ants, holding pee, or licking textbooks were acted with a serious approach and strong emotional involvement. They were incorporating them in their own time. They could perform these actions however often they wanted. Some of them intentionally chose the moments when there was nobody around to act. Soft and ephemeral, personal gestures interrupted and changed the character of routine.","Only very patient and focused viewers could become witnesses to these moments.

This "live scoring" also included taking note of our spontaneous responses.

Our main space was a colorama backdrop, with lines of black string attached to evoke staves or ruled paper, with graphic paper cut-outs that were reminiscent of stickers in their generic nature.

In the case of "Tender Picking," the audience was invited to eat a blue crab while listening to a recording on headphones. Each guest picked up one half of a charged conversation between two lovers who are incapable of intimate connection without one destroying the other. Guests didn't know they were listening to an incomplete story, but it became obvious over time which position they inadvertently stepped into: The Desiring (consumer) or The Object of Desire (crab).","As guests milled around the gallery they drank champagne, listened to a deconstructed Spice Girls track (_Two Become One_), and watched the grotesque distortion of hands carefully picking at animal corpses in the mirror. The spectacle of eating was made conscious and self-aware by its projection into the space. Sitting on a low cushion, surrounded by candles, flowers and champagne, made a typically raucous and careless meal (The Crab Feast) intimate and even sensual. I was told by guests who stumbled unknowingly into the gallery that their experience was "curiously romantic."","The most careful listeners in the crowd came away with a deep sense of sadness, having picked up on racial tension between the lovers:",""I'm pure, white, fleckless!/ But you?/ If I opened you up it'd be so red, so deeply crimson, it'd look black!// (laughs) //So black your insides would disappear!"",""I know I'm full of blood and guts/ Of deep crimson and black/ Of galaxies/ Of endless space/ Terrifyingly endless/ Universes inside of me// The responsibility is enormous"","Some guests, unable to engage at all, left with an overwhelming sense of disgust at the spectacle.

Inside "Tender Picking," true transformation comes in the form of metabolization. By definition, metabolization is the integration of energy sources, a regeneration of the original.

The river is continually held, reestablished. Backpacks are gathered from the audience and movers circle into the air, then the music stops and contamination is tossed into the river. We all begin to gather the tampons, jeans, and plastic bottles and place them in the river. A mover climbs a trapeze, speaks of water as element, and joins us in semicircles by the river where the adapted Polish folk song is sung in English ("oh you river, oh river, why are you so full?").

Through research in each place I develop interactive public performances and public art. In 2017, I was invited to create a two-phase project for the city of Liverpool where I proposed to interview eight women between the ages of 20 to 100, selecting one woman from each decade. I wrote poetry inspired by each conversation, which became a starting point for public performance. As part of the residency supported by We Make Places, I had a solo performance at The Florence Institute aptly named "The Florrie" by locals. The audience was invited to share their important life moments and I selected vocal works from the body of my people poetry that related to the experiences shared by the audience.","As a performance artist I've had a long fascination for spoken dialect and the structure of speech. Being of Scottish descent, our language was banned in the sixteenth century, and I'm fascinated by how this has shaped and formed spoken dialect, and how the roots of the Gaelic language has maintained a musical resonance in the structure of speech. This interest in oral performance traditions influences the structure of my writing and performance. My study of language has taken me to Ancient Greek lyric and choral traditions, as it's fascinating to explore how language is not just impacted by geography and culture, but how it is gendered. I'm interested in creating spaces where open discourse is given liberty, is given permission, is given time, and is listened to.","In integrating poetic speech into lyric and choral compositions, I pose the question of whether this has the capacity to re-establish truth and meaning back into our local communities. As an artist, I act as a conduit in these situations, facilitating discourse and public conversations inspired by the mediums of poetry and public performance. I'm interested in how poetry expands critical discourse, and, by creating an expanded poetic landscape, traces the city—transforming into active social spaces of communication. The role language and the voice plays in our society is vital in building an inclusive and peaceful one."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"Invitation_To_Play_Open_Close_Open.png","photo_credit":"Milcah Bassel","title":"INVITATION TO PLAY | OPEN CLOSE OPEN","first_performed":"first performed on August 4, 2017","place":"Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York, NY","times_performed":"performed three times in 2017","contributor":"MILCAH BASSEL","collaborators":[],"home":"Jersey City, NJ","links":["milcahbassel.com"],"contact":"milcahbassel@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"282-283"},"description":["Seventy-nine individual ceramic vessels constitute a moveable grid, numerically matching a recently-updated count of organs in the human body.

For two hours on the opening night of an exhibition, I navigated the gallery space, moving around event attendees, and using the reflection of a two-sided mirror on casters to guide my movements, observe people, and to record words that I collected by eavesdropping on surrounding discourse.","The mirror worked as a window to observe the people around me. I had my back turned to the observed so that making eye contact referenced the experience of finding oneself watched through a window. This voyeurism became deeply personal through reflection. I used the mirror as a metaphor for where our relationship with ourselves lives. The standing mirror inhabits a role of self-evaluation. It occupies bedrooms, changing rooms, and figure-drawing studios. Observation through a mirror exposes a world of individual familiarity and produces a tension of exposure.","Using reflection to navigate my surroundings had an interesting effect on my relationship with my own image. In order to move and observe, I forgot about my reflection. I found myself treating it as a blindspot. The mirror space provided an escape from personal self-consciousness and the effect of being so close to my own reflection while acting as a perceived barrier to the observed audience. This forced a farsightedness and disconnection that provided me with feelings of disinhibition.","To create an additional sense of surveillance and to compound the visual observation with an auditory element, I was eavesdropping to collect words and record them on the glass. I was a filter, visualizing the linguistic space as if words could be caught floating on the surface of the mirror. I used myself as an authority to take away the control of language and re-present it. I erased and combined speech, with no compositional directive, in order for it to emulate the continual transformation of verbal associations between people.","As a means of possible escape for the audience, the mirror provided a parallel reflection in which I was not operating on the reverse side. People could consider the display of language and view their reflection without feeling watched. While providing an avoidance of my gaze, people confronted their own words and were in the epicenter of my auditory surveillance.

The question of digital presence versus physical presence in occupation remains highly debated among academics and activism theorists. By harvesting data from social media feeds of these two movements, we hope to bring new information to the conversation on links between emotion, dialogue, and action.

We've established familiarity and a history of working together in this spontaneous, collaborative, interdisciplinary manner.","We held our 37th Encounter (the second ever performed for an invited audience) as a fundraiser to bring four guest artists to LA for the Pacific Standard Time Festival: Live Art LA/LA. It was a hot and sticky afternoon. Carol McDowell tap danced in a pool of water. A roll of blue masking tape was used to chart imaginary horizons across the white walls and cement floors. Mariel Carranza fashioned an ersatz breast pump from a plastic funnel, a bellows-style air pump, black duct tape, and a giant white balloon containing turmeric juice which she inflated until it exploded, staining the concrete floor. Paul Outlaw negotiated the space blind, in blacked-out goggles. Sebastian Hernandez changed outfits in 30-minute intervals, like clockwork. Audience members were transformed into participants and co-conspirators. They each brought their own contributions to a communal soup that was shared at the end.","As a nomadic practice, temporarily occupying empty outdoor spaces, rooftops, parks, caves, and alleys, "Encounter" is very much an Angeleno animal. Artists in Los Angeles are constantly on the move, occupying space as they find it, and then moving on to find the next space. When we encounter a new site, we invest literal blood, sweat, and tears into the DNA of the soil, concrete, water, brick, wood, and dust we find there. Our DNA lives in the Venice Pier, the Salton Sea, the "bat caves" of Griffith Park, and the roof tar of now-renovated buildings downtown. We've encountered glass, wire, discarded love letters, soiled garments, wild flowers, rotting chicken carcasses, ground fish bones, and men with knives in whose territory we unwittingly wandered. Encounter is how we live as artists in Los Angeles: we wander, settle, invite friends, respond, create, eat together, and wander on.",""Encounter" as a practice is rooted in performance art, installation, happenings, and public interventions. Indebted to Black Market International for the initial inspiration, our practice of "Encounter," as we have developed it in Los Angeles, is quite different from that of our European colleagues. We are influenced by the countless artists, elders, and groups that have informed each of us. While our "Encounters" are not explicitly acts of political protest, our practice evades capitalist art market structures that commodify performance, as we perform outside of institutions and (normally) without audience or publicity. We evoke the complex histories of the sites we encounter, and channel current events and concerns through our dictum to respond to the "now.""]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"SALUS.jpg","photo_credit":"Madsen Manix","title":"SALUS","first_performed":"first performed on August 12, 2017","place":"Atlantic Salt Company, Staten Island, New York, NY","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"HOLLI MCENTEGART","collaborators":[],"home":"New York, NY","links":["hollimcentegart.com"],"contact":"holli.mcentegart@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"296-297"},"description":[""Salus" was a six hour performance located within an ambivalent landscape constructed from 700 tons of rock salt.

Using this as a blueprint, I modified their ideology to create a box that can hold physical objects representing personal trauma.

Healing energy was channeled and collected into the box. Each action and object had been passed onto me by a different spiritual medium or healer who has collaborated with me on a previous project.

"Reform" revolves around statistics related to the gender pension gap. At the center of this project, I use umbrellas to depict the data as abstract patterns; they are activated in public space through choreography based on Bartitsu, a self-defense technique with umbrella. It was practiced by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes, and was developed between 1898-1902 in the UK by Edward William Barton-Wright.","The first part of "Reform" is called "Yksi, Kaksi, Kolme, Nelja" (_one, two, three, four_ in Finnish) and was a collaboration with contact improviser Kaisa Kukkonen (FI). In this choreography, Bartitsu poses progressively merge into fluid movements, which are finally passed on to the audience in a public rehearsal. The performance's second part, "Social Body," was created in collaboration with ballet dancer Elizabeth Ward (US/AT). Umbrellas turn into abstract representations of the individual and society, and help to visualize our behavior patterns within it. A cluster of umbrellas come to life as one body, lifting and lowering its chest as if it were alive and breathing.","To teach the choreography in workshops, a set of educational material was developed: a method kit consisting of 24 cards, a pull-down chart, as well as a drone video. After stops in Vienna (Museumsquarter) and Zurich (Corner College), the project was developed further as a participatory project in a community center in Helsinki (co-produced by m-cult/CAPP).","The project was triggered by a _Huffington Post_ article stating that "in Switzerland, women will soon receive higher pensions," which referred to the proposal to reduce the current pension gap of 37.1% by a corrective factor of 8% as part of a referendum in September 2017 to reform the Swiss pension system. However, the Swiss National Council rejected this adjustment and the corrective factor has not become part of the reform package. "Reform" supports the initial proposal for the referendum, sparks discussions on the issue and, ultimately, tries to end gender inequality.",""Reform" is part of an artistic practice interested in the political potential of abstraction. Here, abstraction is not only used to help understand complex correlations, but also to mimic codes that are used to claim scientific authority, and, ultimately, to demonstrate alternative aesthetics that allow for a more open reading ("queer abstraction")."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"BANCADA_DA_B_BLIA_E_DA_BALA.jpg","photo_credit":"Lutierry Haubmann","title":"BANCADA DA BÃBLIA E DA BALA","first_performed":"first performed on August 27, 2017","place":"Artist's Studio, Arroio Grande, Brazil","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"FRANCESCO D'AVILA","collaborators":["Brazil"],"home":"","links":["cargocollective.com/francesco"],"contact":"davilafrancesco@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"306-307"},"description":["FRANCESCO D'AVILA","The photo performance "Bancada da Biblia e da Bala" was held in a studio in the city of Arroio Grande, Brazil.

I informed him that I would be performing the "Erase Hate" action at the end of the service when the church members were leaving so that they could witness the performance. The minister told me that the Swastika was backward and therefore he believed "it was a blessing." I explained that it sends a message of hate at the front doors, and should not be have been permitted to remain for well over a year. I told him I was offended and that he was naÃ¯ve to believe that. A parishioner told me during the performance that "she had asked that it be removed and was told that they didn't want to draw attention to it." I borrowed a power-washer from the church after the chemical attempts failed. The high power-washer removed the swastika after 2 hours of work.

For each event, we chose a particular set list of songs, a basic structure around which to weave our songwork.","Each presentation of the "Concert of Fragments" was unique, synthesizing the development of the trio ensemble and our individual processes with specific moments, venues, and audiences.

The cut cake revealed the pattern of a transgender flag, eschewing both gender essentialism and the binary expectations even trans people face as they come out.","I then proceeded to regurgitate icing, "sugar coating" the language around the trans experience, repeating phrases and questions trans people often hear, specifically those I have personally heard, no matter how benign or insulting. This is an inversion of the witty banter drag queens are often expected to improvise for entertainment.","The standard "gender reveal party" divulges the sex of the child (in utero) to its (most likely) heterosexual parent(s). This celebration, precipitating the arrival of the child, narrowly categorizes a child into "boy" and "girl" based on developing sex characteristics. This application of "gender" and public acknowledgement of the child's sex prepares the parents, family, and social group for an expectation of what a child's personality, interest, and identity might be, leading to a lifelong struggle confined in binary gender roles, for both trans children and cisgender children.","Drag queens are traditionally thought of as gay men "impersonating" women, reducing them to a male/female binary. This ignores the history of drag which includes transwomen and transmen as leaders in the movement. Drag has recently found a mainstream foothold again, but this resurgence has primarily left out transgender people. Meanwhile, television programs like "I Am Jazz" and "I Am Cait" profit off the narratives of transgender individuals, often packaging transition stories as neat and binary.","The rituals and culture we participate in are made binary, despite attempts to change them.

The small space created a sense of the audience being a part of the performance at every moment.",""Reality Flux" is an exciting work I created in response to current political and social issues. Creative storytelling became a strategy for exploring novel choreographic ideas. The piece shows two wild science fiction narratives examining how the future develops depending on society's current choices. In the first narrative, environmental protections are eliminated, our country is run by corrupt politicians, and the news is controlled by the government. As we become displaced, everyone behaves aggressively and territorially over severely limited resources. In the second narrative, our government invests in technology and social programs to benefit society. Here individuals relate in a more relaxed and human way. The third section encourages community's active participation in building a better future. The fourth wall is broken and audience members participate in an odd movement ritual. Then we abruptly wander off, leaving the audience wondering if our piece is over. Because decision-making is a continuing process, we wanted a lack of closure.","Important challenges in creating our piece were expressing many ideas, creating a sci-fi piece without having to build complicated, technology driven props, and creating dance for a tiny space. We touched on twelve different exciting ideas in the creation of "Reality Flux." "Reality Flux" could have developed into an evening-length work, but we limited ourselves to twelve minutes to fit into a split concert. Our innovative strategy was to inject two drama segments where newscasters comment on current events in their reality. Since we do not have a props department, videotaping a drama segment was a good tactic to eliminate the need to build a flying car, house with smart technology embedded in the walls, etc. Although we think of "Reality Flux" as a dance piece, the work could be a drama piece with two movement segments.","Music: Not Your Mom/West Side Trio, The Obelisk/Espectrostatic"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"RESISTENCIA.jpg","photo_credit":"Andrea Gomis","title":"RESISTENCIA","first_performed":"first performed on October 2, 2017","place":"beach in Sant Marti D'Empuries, Catalonia","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"EMMA GOMIS","collaborators":["Andrea Gomis"],"home":"Boulder, CO","links":["emmajanegomis.com"],"contact":"emmajanegomis@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"366-367"},"description":["On October 1, 2017 the people of Catalonia held what the Spanish government deemed an "illegal" vote for independence.","We woke up at 5am and arrived shaking off sleep in the dark.

Sharing my story felt like the only way that I could relieve some of the solitude and pain that I was feeling. In this specific piece I use the phrase "I am so sorry," which is one of many phrases that I heard over and over again from people who tried to comfort me. It felt like the more I heard this phrase, the less and less it held any meaning. The stick that I use in the performance is meant to serve as a type of prosthetic. I was thinking about how prosthetics are used to help people when they are experiencing a great loss. When first fitted, the prosthetic hurts and though it is meant to be helpful, can often cause more pain and creates further struggles. The stick also makes writing this phrase over and over again increasingly difficult. The phrase turns from legible writing into an abstraction.

The eight projections, lined up next to each other, along with soundtracks of protest chants, form the activated space within which a group of performers march back and forth chanting and recreating a live protest. Each of their chants and each of their signs are gleaned from the original documented protests in the projections. As they march past each projection, they are progressing through time, from 2003 to 2017. They walk between the projection devices and the projections, throwing their shadows onto the walls, adding another layer of action and protest image to the already densely packed scenes.","The imagery of protest depicted in the projections concentrate on the signage, the visual messages while the accompanying audio concentrates on the repetitive chanting. The stark black and white high-contrast movies condense this even further. The performers gesticulate with black and white signs based on actual signs in the projections and welcome others on the streets to join them in their marching and chanting.","Performed at 21 different locations around New York City, this series "takes it back to the streets," activates spaces and people that are not part of the art world, and engages in a multi-media, multi-dimensional dialogue not only about the content of the various protests (war, capitalism, racism, women's rights, immigrant's rights, police brutality, workers' rights, and more), but also about the use of public space, the co-opting of surfaces with "ephemeral graffiti," the activation of dead areas with the intrusion of moving image, sounds, and performance. It blurs the line between art and activism, reiterating the voices of many, reigniting the cries for justice, for change, for a chance to be heard, to be listened toâ€¦ By combining protests from different eras one gets to navigate through time which reminds us of what was and is important, what has not changed and what is in common with all. They clearly have aesthetic and visceral similarities but also each represent the voice of the people begging to be heard.

The large receiving dishes attached to the helmets have sensitive microphones inside them that allow us to record conversations and the general ambient noise of the city. And since we both record the same sounds from different angles and directions, it adds an unsettling echo effect to the final recordings: our way of creating a multiple simulacrum.","In October of 2017, we were given the opportunity to test the helmets at the San Diego Art Institute's Project Space. This satellite space is used for experimental short-run shows, and it is next to a large urban plaza. As we moved through the outdoor space collecting sound, it became clear that people wanted to interact and understand what we were doing. As they engaged us, they also felt compelled to share personal stories. It was at this point we realized that the stories could be interwoven with the metropolitan sounds to create a clearer depiction of the city.","In November of 2017, we took the helmets to the AiOP (Art in Odd Places) Noise exhibition and spent three days at the festival roaming downtown Orlando, Florida along Orange Avenue. This area of the city contained an interesting cross-mix of locals. We encouraged those pedestrians to engage us in conversation and asked them to share a story about their life in Orlando. Stories were long, short, personal, generic, and everything in between. As we collected the conversations, other sounds from the city cross pollinated the recordings and added unanticipated layers to our soundtrack.

As the weight increases, the strain I exert is exhibited solely by the sound of my breathing, which exasperates with every addition.

I was interested in the experience of viewing the building, how the architecture seemed to expand and contract as you walked under and around it. There seemed to be windows everywhere which made it possible to view my performance from a multitude of perspectives.","For my performance, I created a series of actions that were about the act of looking that I repeated five times with different time lengths. Each sequence began with the action of me holding a 3-yard piece of mesh fabric in front of my body. The fabric has a repeated image from a previous performance of me falling. Some actions were also made to be viewed up close. I placed a mouth expander around my lips, forcing it from side to side, up and down even spinning it around my lips. This distorted my face and exposed the insides of my mouth that normally are not seen. Some actions were repeated within the same sequence but with my shirt over my head, revealing a large white rectangle on the inside of my shirt. Unable to see, this resulted in the actions failing each time. Each sequence always ended abruptly, as to hint that there was more to come. I am interested in repetition and failure as a means of not knowing. Repeating the sequence of actions is a way of removing myself from linear time. The performance ended when I broke the sequence by creating a new action. Ideally, I would have repeated the sequence of actions many more times and because of that, I view this performance as a failure."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"IOUSP_II_edited.jpg","photo_credit":"Constanze Zacharias","title":"IOUSP II","first_performed":"first performed on October 14, 2017","place":""I owe u some pie"—Day 2, Karlsruhe, Germany","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"MARITA BULLMANN","collaborators":["Germany"],"home":"","links":["maritabullmann.de"],"contact":"info@maritabullmann.de","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"394-395"},"description":["1 roll of pink tape","1 branch","1 jug filled with water","1 piece of bush","1 plastic bottle filled with little black stones","sheets of white DIN A4 paper","I prepared this performance as a second iteration on the second day of a performative event.

My obsession with the color appeared before I could understand the deeper meaning and importance of saffron in religious beliefs and politics. In my childhood, I never knew anything through which I could relate saffron to fear, insecurities, death or destruction. It always meant peace, spirituality, pure energy and the path of higher enlightenment.","After the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, this color has played a different role in my mind and in the minds of the people: it is like a mass hysteria, synonymous with fear and insecurity. Today this color again resurfaced due to growing incidences like communal threats and killings. This brought back all the traumatic thoughts and past experiences of staying in my room, enclosed during curfew, seeing hundreds of police patrolling in sensitive areas, and feeling fear and insecurity doubling while passing the sensitive areas. Saffron has become a symbol of fear in my country, the color of spirituality has become the color of fear, and gradual politicization of this color has opened the floodgate in my country.","In this performance I am not only representing my identity and culture but also my current state of mind due to the socio-political conditions prevailing in my country. While my love for saffron should not be affected by this, it is, and the state of mental flux brought on by this contradiction makes it feel like there is war inside my mind. I tried to bring this dichotomy of love and hate, spirituality and materiality, the clash of extremes through the use of voice and body gestures and also through using the color saffron along with audio during the performance. Throughout my performance I tried to negotiate the idea of sacredness of the color, oscillating psychological tension between the love/hate, the purity/impurity of saffron's sacredness. I tried to map the paradigm shift of saffron power, mapping the psychological tension created in this fluctuation through my body. I evoked the power of the body/love of saffron and its use in healing rituals with milk. All through the process, the same question haunts me: what will a common person like me do if someone attacks?

Entry is by membership or invitation only, and there's the allure of a select nightclub after the play's cultural causerie. "Les Singes" ends with Place reciting her own autopsy report from a teleprompter as a dozen select audience members drink champagne to her demise. Toth, wearing a full-face chimpanzee mask and playing the part of The Hostess, carefully chose these audience members, who wear children's monkey masks and eat pastries in the shape of plump nuns. Seated along the edge of the stage, their backs to the audience, these chosen few become disciples at a last supper, as seen from behind. Previously, the Hostess had encouraged the entire audience to celebrate carnival with toy noise makers and plastic palm fronds, after which Place, as Kafka's Rotpeter, read an annotated English version of Kafka's "A Report to the Academy." "Les Singes" is a false inversion of the human and the animal, superimposed on an equally untrue inversion of the human and the divine— inequalities that this Passion revokes, leaving the dilemma: rescind or reinscribe? In our performance, these inversions betray all the conversions that are constantly promised: that monkeys can become men, that men can become gods, and that there is something to us other than the merely human. The performance reminds the audience that monkeys are the only primates who cannot stand to see the body of one of their own kind dissected, making the ape always the better man.

It also became a physical embodiment of our shared inner turmoil during the months before and after the election. It felt like everyone was wrestling on the inside. We decided to turn that into dance.

Blending silent film hijinks with moments of great dramatic intensity felt absolutely right for our mostly wordless retelling.","What also felt right was involving the audience from the start. Audience members entered the theater to the soundscape of a construction site, and were asked to show their "permits." They were then handed a cone (to be used later in wall construction). The final audience member to enter was Antigone, who was run through a slew of ridiculous requests before she was handed a bright orange vest and a STOP/SLOW sign. Thus began her job building the wall against the country she had just come from, under the command of newly-elected Creon.","Among the few words in the piece was a message chalked onto the set near the end, by an actor out of character: "Do YOU have a choice?" It was meant for the audience, who sat looking on as Antigone struggled. She had at this point become a part of the wall. The actor sat with the audience for a moment, watching Antigone with themâ€¦ then got up and kicked down a cone.

A pair of microphones connecting to DSP software allowed for the creation of a variety of voices, so I could deliver monologues or have conversations with myself. At one point, I directed an actual phone call (arranged before the performance) through the software to have a dialogue of reversed voices such that the caller and I could converse without actually communicating.","Meanwhile, a variety of small props were used to enhance or interrupt the experience of the podcast as "live." What are we actually listening for in speech, and what is taken for granted? The field of vocal improvisation and sound poetry opens up the minuscule aspects of the voice, yet in mediated communication such subtlety risks being erased or set aside in favor of meaning, conversation, or the listener's own habits of listening. This performance sought to manipulate the secretly uncanny aspects of the medium by mediating the listener's expectations."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"MEVOY_copy.jpg","photo_credit":"Cyndi Henderson","title":"ME VOY","first_performed":"first performed on November 3, 2017","place":"Casa de Locos, Dallas, TX","times_performed":"performed twice in 2017","contributor":"COCOATLICUE / AMY ZAPIEN","collaborators":[],"home":"Dallas, TX","links":[],"contact":"c0c0fr33kay@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"422-423"},"description":["In the spring of 2017, I spent two weeks with my 75-year-old abuela in La Mora, Guanajuato.

The performance is an ode to the intergenerational trauma grandchildren inherit through diasporic immigrant narratives. The piece explores how these memories are manifested through personal family history and time travel. It was performed during SANA: An Art Gathering, a DIY two-day multi-artist installation. The intent of the show was to showcase emerging local artists from Dallas as a form of resistance to the gentrification happening rapidly in the Oak Cliff neighborhood. We intentionally brought the art world into the home of friends to make our space accessible. "Me Voy" is a weaving and undoing of the stories and sounds of my grandmother's roots. What happens when the dreamer meets her dream?","I created the stage for my performance with curtains, sheets, plastic table covers, and LED lights. The color of the lighting would change at the discretion of a friend while I performed. I distorted three separate audio recordings to create a soundscape of a cricket and mariachi serenade, a church sermon, and a conversation my grandmother had with a taxi driver on our way back home. I then added pieces of one of my poems so that it would seep in between these memories and create a dialogue. As this played, I performed a ritual as an offering of my own memories to my ancestors with gifts I'd received from important women in my life. These gifts included a book by James Baldwin, my great grandmother's tape collection, chocolate from my sister, and a painting of a rose from my art mentor. After the ritual, I took a seat at my writing desk. Masked by a sheer curtain, I rolled a blunt and wrote on my typewriter as the last recording played. My grandmother's voice echoed as she told the taxi driver her immigration story. Afterwards I turned on an old battery radio, and with static playing in the background I broke the fourth wall to read my poem in its full form to the audience. The dream, now a living memory, speaks to the future."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"WhisperingDistanceHenniesZeh_edited.jpg","photo_credit":"Roya Rafiq","title":"WHISPERING DISTANCE","first_performed":"first performed on November 4, 2017","place":"The Jazz Galery, Milwaukee, WI","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"SARAH HENNIES / JASON ZEH","collaborators":[],"home":"Kansas City, MO / Ithaca, NY","links":["jasonzeh.com / sarah-hennies.com"],"contact":"zeh.jason@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"424-425"},"description":["This performance, presented as part of FTAM Productions' Experimental Education Series, explores issues surrounding confession, intimacy, and attempts to quantify identity. The work gives the impression of a deeply personal, embarrassing, or vulnerable mode of secret-sharing while simultaneously erecting barriers preventing listeners from fully accessing the truth of the secrets being confessed.","The work utilized several sound-producing actions. In phase one of the piece, Hennies and I filled in BubbleScan test forms using screws to tear holes in the sheets. The multiple choice and true/false questions were derived from confessions that we wrote. These test forms were placed on top of wooden clipboards that were wired to amplify the sounds of the action. At the end of each set of five questions, we spoke a single word through a metal drinking straw before clipping the test sheet to a clothesline hanging in front of our faces. During this phase of the piece, test sheets accumulated on this string, eventually obscuring the audience's view of us aside from small points of light that shone through the holes in the paper. Here, a standardized test serves as a tool for quantifying and dissecting our secrets while visually blocking out our bodies. Speaking through the straws, an action inspired by vocal exercises designed to strengthen the voice, both facilitates and frustrates communication.","During another phase of the performance, we turned to face one another while using a touch-sensitive device to affect the playback of two retellings of personal secrets. Each of our secrets were told in our respective voices, in the other's voice, and in several transformed versions of both voices. The result was a confession of secrets that refused the desires of the audience to know definitively which secret belonged to which one of us. In the act of confession, both of our identities were momentarily merged into one through the communication technologies in play. During this secret-telling phase, both of us were responsible for managing an ever-growing and ever more unwieldy collection of sound-making toys like wind-up teeth and spinning tops that danced on top of the amplified clipboards.","The final phase of the piece involved taking down the test forms from the clothesline one-by-one and sanding the sheets down to scraps with a wooden sanding block.

I tied a rope to the structure, spanning the distance from the structure's top to the audience. Other smaller actions like falling over, singing, and talking to my audience about the two sides of a vinyl record formed a narrative structure. I then repeated everything, but blindfolded.

Hito Steyerl, in her essay "Is a Museum a Factory?," observes that many places where employees worked on factory lines have recently been transformed into sites of artistic labor. Indeed, many cultural institutions and artist studios are in former industrial spaces. The enterprise may seem more glamorous, but the problems are similar. Our forebears were underpaid for laboring long hours in dangerous circumstances. Today's cultural sector exploits poorly-compensated administrators, unpaid interns, and uninsured artists to produce value at the top of the field. The art world mirrors our society, in which income inequality is exacerbated by a crowd-sourced, freelance economy.","The piece also references my ancestors, who were Italian-American industrial workers. While researching this project, I also read Pietro DiDonato's novel _Christ in Concrete_, which tells the story of an Italian immigrant bricklayer who is killed on the job due to unsafe conditions and whose eldest son is forced to leave school to support his family.","All of this provokes questions about how we, as artists, relate to our working-class forebears and contemporaries. Artists might see themselves as free from class, but no matter where we exist on the totem pole, we are either subject to the art world's hierarchies and unfair systems or we become part of the network that perpetuates them. We occupy low-income neighborhoods, due to our need for affordable space, only to become agents of gentrification and class stratification. This performance explores these issues at a time when much soul searching is needed in the quest for social equity."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"FINAL_SESSION.jpg","photo_credit":"Endam Nihan","title":"FINAL SESSION","first_performed":"first performed on November 10, 2017","place":"Empty theatre stage, Istanbul, Turkey","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"ENDAM NIHAN","collaborators":[],"home":"Orlando, FL / Istanbul, Turkey","links":["endamnihan.com"],"contact":"nihanendam@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"442-443"},"description":[""Final Session" is a performance made for the online VR exhibition, V/Art Projects.

Viewers enter the piece with their gaze directed at me, dressed in grey on a bare proscenium stage. About every thirty seconds, a disembodied voice begins a countdown from three, initiating a sequence of gestures mimicking the act of receiving various forms of physical abuse. Upon exploring the 360-degree scene space, viewers find themselves alone with me in an empty theatre with the option of participating along with the tutorial, or acting as a silent witness.","A secondary space emerges as viewers direct their gaze elsewhere from my performance, triggering various buttons embedded in the VR device that transport them to the same empty stage and theatre.

No one asked, and I did not broadcast my "project" to anyone. I did not go out of my way to document the other riders on the bus; I did not want that to be the point. One of the reasons for doing this stemmed from considering my privileges in this small town of intense economic inequality. Other recent events also motivated this, like the demonstration by Pokanoket tribe members demanding the return of some of their sacred land. Later I attended an (unrelated) event where one of the speakers (a friend) began by thanking those who had made the event possible, including those whose labor was invisible. Later when I saw him I said I appreciated that comment, and also wondered out loud if we should be doing what they do in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—beginning events with an "Acknowledgement of Country"—and he said, "What's the point? Why not just give it back then?" And I thought, yeah that's right—action. I didn't have power to give the land back, but after that I decided to boycott Thanksgiving, the holiday of eating a huge feast to celebrate and be _thankful_ for having been born on the privileged side of the grand narrative. Even after deciding on my boycott, I wondered if I would cave into one of the nice offers I received to join somebody's holiday meal. I had many nice offers from dear, wonderful people and for that I am grateful. Sometime closer to the day itself, I made a new friend, who asked over e-mail if I had "plans for the weekend after the settler-colonialist-klepto-capitalist, nationalist holiday" and I said that I was free on "the weekend following the imperialist-genocidal-white-supremacist holiday."

The Urak Lawoi had been nomadic fisher-people for over five centuries before they settled on Koh Lanta, but like many indigenous peoples, their ancestral lands have been stolen by colonizers, and more recently by businesspeople from the mainland who are building a tourism industry. The festival's goal was for artists to create work in several different sites that are important to the Urak Lawoi, and to draw attention to the threats facing them.","I performed "Evolution" in a village that is perched on stilts above muddy flats at the water's edge. My points of departure were the Urak Lawoi's name for themselves, "Sea People," and their centuries-long identity as nomadic fisher-people. While walking on the beach my first day in Koh Lanta I noticed what looked to me like a sculpture, or an installation. It was long poles tied together, each with a rock tied to the bottom, a large green or yellow plastic jug in the middle, and different brightly colored flags at the top. I learned that these poles are used by the Urak Lawoi to mark the sites of their underwater fish traps. They gave me permission to use a few in my performance.","I began my piece curled up in a square wheelbarrow pushed from the houses out to the water by Xiaohan Han and Kurt Johannessen. They emptied me into the sea, from which I emerged pulling myself forward across the mud on my belly, in the manner in which I imagine the first amphibians crawling onto land. I crept forward, smearing mud on my face and exploring the objects in my path—leaves, twigs, trash. When I reached an Urak Lawoi fishing boat, made from wood and painted in the traditional style, I used it to pull myself up to standing.

At the same time, public performance can be a peaceful and profound act in reaction and in opposition to the New Military Reform, which allows for the military to be present in public spaces and to intervene with civil society whenever it wants.","In a society full of violence, and with the case of the New Military Reform in Mexico, which restricts political expression in public spaces (like marches, political dissent, etc.), this communal happening represents the power to express oneself and to intervene public spaces through bodies as a political act. However, far from being an attack, it is a way of full expression that unifies all the participants to create another kind of possible community, through contemporary life and art together.","We made the performance act visible and invisible in turn; we explored the performance act as an act that can permeate society and the individual. During the action, it was suggested in a free form of expression that all performers intervene at the Revolution Monument on Revolution Square as a symbol; also, it was agreed that we would integrate certain principles contained in the book _The Coming Insurrection_ by The Invisible Committee, which talks about the change that the world needs, inhabiting and participating in public space, fostering new possible forms.","Thus, our action involved responding in a peaceful way and taking the arts to other audiences, integrating both early stage and recognized career artists as participants and performers, creating actions outside of regular Mexican art and performance institutions, and, in a subtle way, breaking the laws of what the New Military Reform would suppose (something that will not stop us from continuing to operate peacefully in public spaces)."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"KohLanta2560.jpg","photo_credit":"Wichai Juntavero","title":"KOH LANTA 2560","first_performed":"first performed on November 26, 2017","place":"Koh Lanta Beach, Koh Lanta, Thailand","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"ELIU ALMONTE","collaborators":[],"home":"Los Angeles, CA","links":["eliualmonte.com"],"contact":"e-art.factory@hotmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"470-471"},"description":["In the south of Thailand, in the popular tourist destination of the province of Krabi, on the island of Koh Lanta, live the indigenous people, called the Urak Lawoi.

In my performance, I conducted a series of scored movements in response to a video piece which loops two hands exchanging soil. These movements took place in a three-foot by eight-foot wooden frame filled with soil. The light emitting from the video was my catalyst. At the end of my performance I offered out my hands, filled with soil, as a form of communion. One by one, spectators were welcomed forward to participate in receiving this offering. As a participant came forward, I spread the soil over their arms and hands, conducting an exchange. The purpose of this piece is to explore the materiality of blue ambient light as a powerful catalyst for meditation and ritual, while simultaneously grounding the body as a physical, tactile object through the process of exchange. This work is meant to respond to the cultural dismissal of ritual. Connection as a rite of passage carries value. As soil is passed from one hand to another, a person is initiated into a new community: a people group who now share this material.

This lecture performance was commissioned for the Royal Academy of Arts latest event "Rrose SÃ©lavy's Dada Extravaganza." Taking as its starting point the centenary of Duchamp's (or rather: R. Mutt's) rejected _Fountain_, my performance proposed to "see" the work differently when "read" in the context of Duchamp's co-edited magazine _The Blind Man_, where it appeared as a photograph by Alfred Stieglitz in 1917. The script meditated on fountains and fountain pens, portraits and replicas, women and bird cages, sequences and consequences. My performing persona echoed the image of the "reading woman" (in a dressing gown, draped over a sofa)—a common painterly trope and an obsession for philosophers and writers alike as an epitome for "attention." My set consisted of a sofa, an arm chair, an empty golden picture frame, and a pedestal on which I placed a heart-shaped bar of soap in homage to Duchamp's co-editor Beatrice Wood, who exhibited her semi-ready-made _Un peut _[sic]_ d'eau dans du savon_ also in 1917.","My impetus was to rectify a particular historical account and hagiography around Duchamp and to take seriously the question of how _Fountain_'s conceptual stunt and its social and cultural context can do some work for us aesthetically and politically today. This was less about "relevance" than about a different understanding of contemporaneity (something I've called a "movable contemporaneity" elsewhere). How materials that are historical—both mine and not mine—can have an afterlife (or multiple lives) is something that's been preoccupying me for a while now. Consequently, the performance also reflected on reading as interpreting, performance as research, and how we make art history beyond major exhibitions dedicated to the big daddies of Dada and Surrealism. One challenge was how to present such experimental work to an audience primed for entertainment, dressed as Surrealist paintings and taking their plastic lobsters for a walk.","I had initially been asked to perform the same piece twice, but—not wanting to be the replica I addressed in my performance—I decided instead to make seriality, copying, and re-reading an integral element of my script, to create two parts that worked independently _and_ in conjunction. The script included material from my piece _3,4_ (2013), copied to serve a new function, and the performance concluded with me blindfolding myself, not-seeing my video _Objects I Cannot Touch_ (2014) play in the background."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"untitled.jpg","photo_credit":"Soojin Chang","title":"UNTITLED","first_performed":"first performed on December 9, 2017","place":"Nexus Transcontinental  Performance Art Platform at Edge Zones Art Gallery, Miami, FL","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"RACHELLE BEAUDOIN","collaborators":[],"home":"Peterborough, NH","links":["rachellebeaudoin.com"],"contact":"rachelle.beaudoin@gmail.com","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"494-495"},"description":["In this untitled performance I built and manipulated the space or landscape around me, performing a monotonous and undefined task before revealing the purpose of the action.

Roofing is an indispensable constituent of houses, functioning as a defensive armour against climate and external risks without which the "oikos" (Greek word referring to three related but distinct concepts: the family, the family's property, and the house) is exposed to danger.

Eventually, after three hours, what felt impossible becomes possible; the tile breaks and the subtle sound of "breakthrough" gives a new impetus to continue the process of transformation into prima materia: a task which is destined to fail to be completed. The performance ends, but the journey continues.","In an era when the concepts of home and safety are threatened by hierarchical structures of oppression and military power, individuals are called to stand up, resist, persist, and keep on transforming inner frustration into determination for a radical change.

A black horizontal line of the dancer's body (Olga Merekina) contrasted with both the light, airy space, and with the red vertical appearance of the sound artist (Lena Kilina). The latter was holding a hammer and wooden block in her hands. Silence was broken with a stroke of the hammer and the sharp, deep voice of the artist whose sound was directed at the solid body of the dancer. Single words were becoming recitative supported by rhythmical strokes of the hammer, while Olga's body, motionless at first, began to deform and reshape. Lena's speech was gradually transformed into a song that filled the space and moved toward reaching the frequency of the body. As soon as the resonance was achieved, the dancer's movement became fluid and three-dimensional. The voice, like a magnet, attracted the body, and when Olga crossed an imagined line of event horizon, the sound and her movements faded out, while both still resonated in the air. Finally, Olga touched the source of sound and closed Lena's mouth with her hand."]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"Especially_Cabbages1_edited.png","photo_credit":"Alissa Walls","title":"ESPECIALLY CABBAGES, FOR PIERRE BOURDIEU","first_performed":"(WHAT TO MAKE OF THE GOLD ONES?)","place":"","times_performed":"first performed on December 31, 2017","contributor":"Historic Stone Cellar, Fayetteville, AR","collaborators":["ALISSA WALLS"],"home":"Fayetteville, AR","links":["alissawalls.com"],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"516-517"},"description":[" \n(WHAT TO MAKE OF THE GOLD ONES?)","ALISSA WALLS","Viewers entered the gallery through a metal gate highlighted in gold enamel and held open by a frayed rope. A stack of green cabbages sat on a pedestal in the corner. Another was centered on a field of gray felt, which displays postcards featuring historical landscapes. During the performance I moved the cabbages individually from the pedestal to a unique site on the felt field, brushing each cabbage with gold pigment. I alternated between painting cabbages and writing on the back of each postcard: "A work of art is an object of popular imagination." After writing on all the postcards, I painted broad horizontal brushstrokes over the landscape images, turning them upside down, so the landscape face was affixed to the pedestal by paint. Only the phrase remained visible.","This work addressed class and aesthetics through the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's work on the construction of taste in _Distinction_ (1984). Bourdieu's sociological survey suggests that images such as landscapes prove most desirable among the working classes, the least popular being photographs of car crashes. A photograph of a "metal frame" stands among the most attractive to the upper classes, and, "especially cabbages." This "taste for formal complexity," Bourdieu argues, reinforces a particular "aesthetic legitimacy."","My piece points to Bourdieu's work with absurdist humor, but ultimately there is nothing amusing about it. As he argues, "There is no way out of the game of culture; and one's only chance of objectifying the true nature of the game is to objectify as fully as possible the very operations which one is obliged to use in order to achieve that objectification." There is a strangeness in painting green cabbages gold, in their transformation from a historical food of impoverishment to a spiritual mecca wherein one visitor solemnly professed: "This is the Room of the Golden Cabbages."","With the threat of autocracy today, I wonder about the stability of the rules of the culture game, and whether their fall may be as progressive as those on the left, seeking greater socioeconomic and cultural equality, might desire. What will be gained and lost in such a cultural game change as painting cabbages, deplored by the working class, gold?"]},{"info":{"layout":"project","volume":"2017","image":"_UNTITLED__edited2.jpg","photo_credit":"JenÃ©e Childers","title":"UNTITLED","first_performed":"first performed on December 31, 2017","place":"Historic Stone Cellar, Fayetteville, AR","times_performed":"performed once in 2017","contributor":"JENÃ‰E CHILDERS","collaborators":[],"home":"Fayetteville, AR","links":[],"contact":"","footnote":"","tags":[],"pages":"518-519"},"description":["I walked around a space surrounded by strung up pillows and sporadically belted out an unrestrained primal scream of frustration.

This performance was a therapeutic purge of emotions to release the fear, anger, and sadness in my own heart. The noose I wore around my neck represented the individual, me, as an antagonizing force.","At some points of my performance, I was sobbing. The difference between my screams and crying became almost indistinguishable to me. A cathartic outburst of emotions is just what I needed and wanted everyone else to experience.

We began by adorning multiple pairs of women's stockings, chosen to represent our own skin. We selected long dresses for warmth and pocket knives for utility. We sat on the floor, in the center of a cold room, and laboriously stitched the toes of our stockings together. We worked one layer at a time, one needle and thread at a time. As one of us stitched, the other guided the thread. The very slow, methodical movements of the arms, back and forth, enveloped us into a sort of trance like state. If at times our bodies cramped or lost feeling, we would pause to stretch or massage one another.","Once sewn together, we used our upper body strength to slowly pull ourselves apart; our hands to the floor, we pushed away from one another. We became dependent on our pocket knives to release pressure from around the waist, in hopes to maintain the stitches at the toes. We intended to shed each layer of the stockings jointly and simultaneously, but we struggled to balance the strength of each suture with the power of our own bodies. Our desire to work together challenged our desire to achieve individual freedom from the layer. Each time we pulled ourselves apart, one of us succeeded while the other was left to remove the layer independently. We repeated this action until both of us shed our five unwanted layers. Our final gesture was to remove our dresses. With one needle and thread, we worked together to stitch the openings of our sleeves together. Once completed, we stood and leaned towards one another, pulling the dresses over our heads and onto the floor. We abandoned the layers and walked towards the new year, renewed.",""Resolve" was performed in tandem with three other durational works by female artists. In the last hours of 2017, JenÃ©e Childer's muffled screams and Leilani Law's singing bowls floated through the air, occasionally offset by the subtle crunch of Alissa Wall's cabbages. "Resolve" was created for Last Night Fayetteville, a New Year's Eve Festival in. Facilitated by Inverse Performance Art, it was performed in a historic stone cellar, now home to Fenix Fayetteville."]}]

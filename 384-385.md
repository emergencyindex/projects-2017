GORRIÓN ROTO: APARICIONES 
(BROKEN SPARROW: APARITIONS)

PARPADO TEATRO

Another chapter in the saga of "Gorrión Roto (Broken Sparrow)", "Aparaciones (Apparitions)" explores the imagination of our character, a woman who has been mentally broken by an emotional trauma in her past. For this piece, we focus on her visions, her selves, her images, totems, and metaphoric associations. Using early cinema techniques reminiscent of masters like Georges Méliès, who saw this new medium as a tool to create magic, we looked for a way to make whims and passing fancies visible. To do this, we had to film onsite and create the entire imaginary ballet of selves, hours before the actual performance. We looked for encounters between the filmed multiplicity of selves we had set and the site-specific choreography that the actor would perform in the character's attempt to escape her selves. Chimera and flesh, which is which? Dream and event; an imagined dignity and all the sensations of humiliation. Superimposed images; conflicting erasures of what is real and what is memory. The necessity of multiplicity when the facts as they are will not stay in the cranium but buzz around the head like bees. A splintered self rises and tries to interact with everything projected around it. Our character is in pieces, and here her fragments take form—her final gesture is always to get to that place where she may wholly flower again. Duration: 21 minutes.

In this performance, I use a large political map of the world and a square shaped metal plate with the inscription â€œOrt Der Angstâ€ (which translates to â€œPlace of Fearâ€ in German) as a guide while I draw red and black lines. These lines are symbolically in the form of arrows going from west to east or from east to west across all continents.

In my recent performance work, I examine the relationship of my body and my personality to the world, using the most commonly symbolized map of the world. In this work, I emphasize my own concerns and concern for the fate of todayâ€™s man. The performance process metaphorically points to the possible consequences for humankind, indicated by the current state of the world and the times in which we live.

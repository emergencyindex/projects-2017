â€œFluxus Score: Dismissed Artistsâ€ is both an educational and political score. I intended it to raise the level of awareness of female artistsâ€™ issues. You can perform it solo or with other performers.

Show the numbers only on a board, card, or slide. State the facts.

You can use the data provided or update it with more current information.

The Numbers:

â€¢ $135 million

â€¢ $51.3 million

â€¢ 6%

â€¢ 5

â€¢ 4%

â€¢ 0

The Facts:

â€¢ $135 million: the gap between the highest priced artwork ever purchased at auction and the highest price ever purchased at auction for a female artistâ€™s work

â€¢ $51.3 million: the gap between the highest auction record for a living male artist to that of a living female artist

â€¢ 6% of editors: females made less than 600 edits on Wikipedia

â€¢ 5: the number of women who made the list of the top 100 artists by cumulative auction value between 2011-2016

â€¢ Less than 4%: the number of women artists in the Modern Art section of New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Museum of Art, but 76% of the nudes are female

â€¢ 0: the number of women on the highest-selling individual lots for living artists (2011-2016)

This performance was part of a larger, ongoing body of work entitled â€œAMBIENT.â€ I am interested in harnessing blue ambient light as a catalyst for movement. My performance contextualizes this light as a liturgical element, influencing the body to move and respond. In my performance, I conducted a series of scored movements in response to a video piece which loops two hands exchanging soil. These movements took place in a three-foot by eight-foot wooden frame filled with soil. The light emitting from the video was my catalyst. At the end of my performance I offered out my hands, filled with soil, as a form of communion. One by one, spectators were welcomed forward to participate in receiving this offering. As a participant came forward, I spread the soil over their arms and hands, conducting an exchange. The purpose of this piece is to explore the materiality of blue ambient light as a powerful catalyst for meditation and ritual, while simultaneously grounding the body as a physical, tactile object through the process of exchange. This work is meant to respond to the cultural dismissal of ritual. Connection as a rite of passage carries value. As soil is passed from one hand to another, a person is initiated into a new community: a people group who now share this material. This ritual is designed to be binding, a promised land to the foreigner.

I staged â€œGozo: The Medium is the Messenger,â€ a poetry and multimedia performance at Theatre B at the University of Iowa. In this performance, I read poems in multiple languages and writing systems, such as Japanese (kanji, hiragana, and katakana), English, and French, among others. With stones hanging from my mouth and a sheep bell around my neck, I created music and language using a hammer, fetish objects, my bare hands, and breath work, while painting on large, yellow sheets of paper. In river-like movements, photographer Toko Shiiki captured the performance on film.

The poem â€œBurningâ€ featured fiction writer and translator Kyoko Yoshida (translation by Takako Lento); â€œThe Old Poetâ€ featured poet and translator Sawako Nakayasu (translation ibid); â€œThe Love Treeâ€ featured poet and translator Derek Gromadzki (translation by Eric Selland); and â€œfrom Devilâ€™s Windâ€ featured Gromadzki, Yoshida, and Nakayasu together with poet and translator Forrest Gander and scholar Kendall Heitzman (translation by Brenda Barrows).

The aforementioned artists and I performed with the University of Iowaâ€™s â€œLaptop Orchestra,â€ directed by composer and clarinetist Jean-FranÃ§ois Charles. This included improvisational musical performances on the setar, live electronics, guitar, Buchla analog synthesizer, and electric bass.

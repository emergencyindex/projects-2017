ES UNA PREGUNTA ABIERTA (IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION)

"Es Una Pregunta Abierta (It's An Open Question)" is a site-specific action carried out at Ni Una Menos, a women's march that takes place annually in Argentina and other Latin American countries since 2015. This march stems from the initiative of journalists, artists, and activists. It then spread to the rest of society with the purpose of raising awareness on the issue of femicide in Argentina-where a woman is murdered every 30 hours-and the demand for public policies on this matter.

The action had two stages: the first stage consisted of physical and emotional preparations before the demonstration. Marches in Argentina and Latin America tend to be intense and sometimes dangerous environments, and it's necessary to be in a state of presence to take part in one.

The second stage, carried out during the march, consisted of unfolding, from arm to arm in front of the chest, a black flag with the phrase "ES UNA PREGUNTA ABIERTA (IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION)" printed in white letters, emulating a human shield. This presence in the public space, coexisting with the rest of the demonstrators, generated different reactions, both empathy and violence, which gave meaning to the action.

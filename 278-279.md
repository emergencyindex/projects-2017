I have been living in Oaxaca, Mexico since November 2013. I find a certain solace in the everyday act of reading at the newspaper stands which conveniently post their periodicals for passersby to collectively read front page headlines. As a Black US citizen living abroad, this experience has also amplified my identification with the concept of double consciousness, which W.E.B. Du Bois describes in his seminal work, _The Souls of Black Folk_. As the current US presidency proliferates its neocolonialist policies in relation to Mexico, I find myself searching the news for connections to my own intersectional identity. Drawing this thread around my body and across the city streets is my own way of marking possible futures of resistance which I yearn to embody in this performance action.

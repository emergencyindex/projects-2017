Maria Inkoo is a rebellious feeling. It is a band made out of performance makers as a way of smuggling in something unexpected and hard to define, in the shape of a band. We play eco-feminist, tectonic cunt-rock.

In our gigs the spirit of Maria Inkoo is called and manifested in five bodies through songs, stories, spoken word, insane repetition, human/animal movement and random notes played with confidence. We perform at the intersection of eco-feminist revolution and weird party entertainment.

We wanted to address the idea that "everyone can make music." The band is nonhierarchical and exists without typical roles of the singer, drummer, bass guitarist etc. Our work is inspired by feminist history, interspecies relations, posthumanism, post-capitalism, and the economics of sex and the sex of labor. We work collaboratively, tell our own stories, use found text, and trade instruments and obsessions. Maria's practice is open. We started by getting gigs early and often, and so our progress and failure is out in the world. It's raw. No two gigs are the same; we have new material all the time. The performance is somewhere between live art, a punk gig, theatre and games with occasionally inappropriate, sexual behaviour with the audience.

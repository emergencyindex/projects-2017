"100 Keyboards: Moir&eacute; Resonance by Interference Frequency" was a site-specific sound installation that I created for the Kobe Art Village Center. My focus in this project was to explore the possibilities of complex sound interaction and modulation while using coherent/correlated sound waves of a nearly identical frequency from multiple sources.

Spatialized drones were created by placing over 100 keyboards in a circular layout. Although all of the keyboards played the same note with a theoretically identical frequency, the idiosyncrasies of cheaply produced keyboards resulted in dense, multidirectional, and superposing patterns of wave propagation. As a result, my performance created distinctive auditory artifacts that transformed its characteristics according to the position of the listener. I have referred to these physical phenomena as spatial resonances in moir&eacute; patterns, generated by sound wave interference.

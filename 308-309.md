As part of â€œbeing,â€ we contend with the burdens that weigh on us. These struggles are manifested within ourselves, challenging the simplest of tasks. The invisible yet cognitive weight makes itself known in these tasks, whether through minor ailment or serious illness, often shakes our core momentarily and during ongoing circumstances. At times, we are in complete control, and at other times, we are overcome with weakness. We are left struggling between embracing our vulnerability or abandoning it in fear that we might not have the strength to carry the weight.

â€œThe Burden of Thisâ€ is an act of dragging my weight in manure while walking. Duration: 26 minutes. Performed at the Pittsburgh Performance Art Festival, 2017.

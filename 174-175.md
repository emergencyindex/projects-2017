Two figures covered in cardboard assemblages meet in a wooded area. Their appearance evokes both colorful robots and armored knights. They shake noisemakers as they approach each other. They move awkwardly about and begin to attack one another with their long noodly lances. The battle escalates and they become more aggressive, ripping off each other's cardboard coverings, whacking away with the pieces they tear away. Eventually, the armor is destroyed and they leave in opposite directions, neither having won.

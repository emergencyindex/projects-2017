"Since no form is intrinsically superior to another, the artist may use any form from an expression of words (written or spoken) to physical reality, equally."

â€”Sol LeWitt, _Sentences on Conceptual Art_

The performance conceptualization is simple: Travel to Zayachy Island, enter Menshikov Bastion, and spend fifteen minutes thinking of as many kennings as possible; then write them down on a sheet of paper. The task seems trivial but at one time, individual thought was not permitted. It was all about group think. Next, join these words together with this statement to constitute a final form of the performance and return home. No more no less.

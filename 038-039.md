We observe:

Interaction avoidance is based in fear, global identity or self-preservation in a highly accelerated environment. Social, entertainment and information needs are satisfied through technology use and contribute to insular autonomy. Affirmation or "like grouping" of opinions and interests, mass or niche, can be identified with, conformed to or rejected. These non-local alliances impact local interaction.

Environmental apathy, consumption and insecurities can be justified when external factors are considered. A narrative of support or condemnation can be constructed for any subject.

Pornography and advertising are shifting tendencies of desire and physical awareness toward objectification, narcissism, imitation, and emotional protection. Sexuality is influenced by exposure to and consumption of directed and often violent content at developmental ages.

Thirteen characters in symbolic and sculptural costumes perform an intermedia tableau. A balance of elements and actions are grouped to identify consumer and device-centric culture. Durational rhythm and repetition draws focus to the correlation between costume, actions, groupings, and audio-visual content. Together in a geometric set design, we perform a ritual of technology, nature, sexuality and consumption that is perpetuated through time.

"Millennials" incorporates advertising aesthetics, content saturation and the use of audience and performer's devices as modes of communication throughout the performance. Video is projected on two screens suspended above the performers and live-edited using footage of resource extraction, natural disasters, mono crop farming, animal mating rituals and high tech manufacturing with overlays of emoji depicting flora or fauna. Periodically the screens cut to a close-up live feed of the performers. An open set design and lack of seating encourages the audience to wander through the space to investigate elements, individually and as a whole. A mirror, visual playground and arena for meaning making, "Millennials" aims to reconcile psychological trends associated with technology use and prompt awareness, connection and engagement, off screen and on.

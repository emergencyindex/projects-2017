The artist's hub _Untitled_ is filled with people. The video is laid out in three projections on the wall. Sensual portrait frames interchange with close ups of moving tissue, surreal actions are repeated, semantic failures occur.

There are people in the crowd whose bodies begin to change, like in gaga technique, simultaneously acquiring the state of metal and the state of water. At some point performers begin to mirror each other with a lag, gradually involving spectators in the action. Then the voice appears. Words are moving around again and again in circles, being transmitted from person to person. The sound depends on what's happening in the hall: it can become more dense, or almost dissolve in a monotonous rhythm. The fabric on the video is movingâ€¦

The aim of this event was to create an opportunity for both video artists and live performers to share their artistic raw material openly, without being embarrassed about its in-process state or the appearance of incompetence; it was to create possibilities for ironic provocative flirting with time. The same was true of the bodily task for performers.

Video artists were invited to use the exposition space like a space for deconstruction. They had to dissect their one-channel video works so that they could be decomposed into several projections. Artists could work with the parameters of scale, time, abandon the sound, use a collaboration with musicians. They could do a recycling of their own work. Artists were not limited to a certain topic; they were to be free to choose the medium through which works were created: video art, digital art, or a combination of static and dynamic time.

The team of performers was invited separately from video artists, under the guidance of dancer Anna Leonova. They were suggested to research the state of one's own body dissynchronism, to reveal certain regularities of this process, as well as the possibility to involve the viewer in it.

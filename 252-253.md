"Target Practice" is a five-minute solo dance I composed and performed as part of a free showing at the deSingel in Antwerp. Derived from various prompts of stream-of-consciousness writing, the movement became an entrance into a cerebral maze.

I wrote in lists about, "I am someone who…," ten precious objects, and five fears.

I attempted to identify aspects of an authentic self that I wanted to structure into a version of a dancing and moving identity. However, I found it interesting how my written thoughts felt like something that was not solely mine once they were physicalized into motion. I began to wonder about the cycling/recycling that happens in the thought process, and I realized that the contents of the mind are in a kinetic state. Focusing on the kinetic experience of thought procession, based on my experience performing the piece, led me to a liminal physical state. I call this state "medium."

Medium:

Extremity within a place

Prevents breaking

The blurriness between paradise and asylum

The blurriness between left and right

Poesis (make, frame)

Catching up after the delay

Abandon

Entering or exiting a place/space

Monotone

Presence/absence

Truth vs. authentic

Pink and blue

Horizontal

Within what I can see

My self is a place/space

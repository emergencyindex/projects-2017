FOUNDATION / PERFORMANCY FORUM

"Justice, it is said, must not only be done, it must be seen to be done."

-Homi K. Bhabha

"Just Situations" is a hybrid conference, festival, and "political science fair," hosting artists and active citizens who are working in performative ways. It hosted those moving beyond the trending commercialization of art "about" politics into modes of performance which directly construct, research, speculate, design, position, and posit "just" forms of political, social, and personal being and becoming.

"Just Situations" took place across two weekends in July, 2017 in Brooklyn, New York and involved situations intentionally situated by situators.

"Just Situations" were situated by:

"Weights Wall (45lbs)" is an eight-hour endurance performance that deals with ideas of responsibility, commitment, and struggle. I sporadically lift weights above my head in a military press until I can't hold them any longer, and then the wall in front of me is used as leverage. Faint lines are created from the weights that become increasingly darker as the marks layer on one another from each failed attempt.

This work is derived from the interest in wanting an "adventure." One of us lives in upstate New York so the three others of us drove up on two separate occasions to have rehearsal. All aspects of collectiveness and collaboration allowed the piece to unfold. The main objects in the work are the custom-welded platform with handle and the blue stone harvested during one of our rehearsals. The artist upstate is a child, and their weight was matched with the harvested stone. The Feminist Art Group works on collectiveness and allowance for all participating artists to contribute to the final work. This was the first piece that had more structure since its fruition in 2015. The structure was the focus on four artists meeting each other where they were and making a piece. Our actions in the work were based on labor, necessity, care for the stone, care for each other, and expansiveness.

Through physical endurance and humor, "TrailBoss" delves into the term "inverted sexuality," which came to prominence at the turn of the twentieth century in the US as a way to describe non-heterosexual desire. Through a cowboy persona, "inversion" functions as double-entendre as my body shifted between a lasso motion and utilizing a Skip-It (the latter producing the same motion as a lasso, simply upside-down/inverted). The determination of the duration of the performance depended on lassoing and using the Skip-It in sync for 100 rounds. The rhythmic building, and eventual finding of a coalescence between my body and each rotating component engendered a 45-minute work. Lassoing is an action that is meant to capture or wrangle an object (of desire) outside of reach. In this work, there is no clear object, and the gesture—as operational—becomes a repetitive failed act. Shifting between the lasso and the Skip-It reinforced a lack, and ultimately, connected the term "inverted sexuality" with a larger concept of (continual) queer failure/loss/desire. At the same time, the work thickly references the aesthetic mythologies of the cinematic and picturesque cowboy.

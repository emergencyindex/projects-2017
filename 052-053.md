I'm continuing to perform "labor" at my grocery store and in a field near my house. The labor is based on the idea that in these circumstances, I am not being paid, but I am performing the action based on the good of the community and on what I may be called upon to perform if I was employed there. I stay at the job site as long as possible, without necessarily interacting with anyone. These actions help me understand my own expectations of myself and others. When I give myself a "job," I create certain expectations for what I produce or accomplish during my labor.

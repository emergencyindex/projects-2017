Perhaps, in the very near future,

All people have to do is to buy a Super Perfect Working Robot.

No longer need to go out for work,

So long as we have more money, we can buy working robots of better functionsâ€”
a working robot that can do any job.

It is like playing video games, only the working robot has to rush for work,

While we only give orders or instructions

And use our fingers to count bills.

Thus I personify another identity: Super Perfect Working Robot Rich An.

I personified another identity for the Super Perfect Working Robot: I adopted the name Rich An, which is considered by fortune tellers to be a name suitable for finding good jobs. With dress-up and performance art, I started the journey of this robot seeking jobs on the streets of Taipei City as well as many career fairs. This worker, with delicate make-up, snow-white skin, flat voice, and steep movement, strikes to finish all tasks. While giving away self-made employment-seeking DM, I want to express a sense of emptiness from working, inside my mentality and inauthenticity as the soulless and yet highly diligent Rich An.

My art creation derives from real-life situations. I often feel "hypothermia" both internally and externally during working. Such hypothermia comes from a dilemma resulting from being unable to identify with myself consciously as well as a twisted employment environment in the current society. I further adopt the performance art approach to tightly connect with public audience via daily life. Like a guerrilla, I allow the working robot to be seen and encountered by the public even on the streets.

I implant this employment-seeking robot into the social spectacle. For two years, I have been inside the employment environment to conduct personal trials, and now I have developed a unique recruitment system and mechanism. During this project, the robot does not choose job types or salaries, but makes its best effort to try many jobs and thus collects many stories and anecdotes in society. My hope is that viewers will reflect on their own life experiences when watching from a distance the ridiculous and yet very real process of being a robot and looking for a job.

â€œCreditsâ€ is a collaborative, performative, and sonic work which consists of a simultaneous durational reading of credits from the film Alien vs. Predator by my sons: John Truly, age 17, Beauregard, age 12, and I. Motivated by a fascination with the acquisition of written and spoken language, â€œCreditsâ€ harnesses the many and varied possibilities to be found in the gift of neuro-diversity.

Originally from La Jolla, California, I am not constrained by any specific medium. My recent trans-disciplinary work encompasses and integrates painting, sculpture, performance, digital technology, installation, and photography. My work examines the performance of masculinity, the valorization of labor, the pursuit of leisure, and the marshalling of amity, using both the spoken and gestural aspects of human communication.

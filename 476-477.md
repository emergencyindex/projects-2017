I made this piece in response to certain things in my life that might never happen, waiting on those things, and moving on from them. Itâ€™s about having that little bit of play while waiting on something, kind of like anticipating your date at a fancy dinner, or even at home. The audience sees me in the middle of a room, with a table set up with candles, and a LEGO placemat. As the piece goes on, I slowly place LEGO pieces onto the mat one by one. The piece starts out visually simple, but the abstract placement of the LEGOs continues. The piece ends when I decide not to wait anymore, and that moment varies, depending on the situation or what Iâ€™m thinking about the situation.

I made this piece in response to certain things in my life that might never happen, waiting on those things, and moving on from them. It's about having that little bit of play while waiting on something, kind of like anticipating your date at a fancy dinner, or even at home. The audience sees me in the middle of a room, with a table set up with candles, and a LEGO placemat. As the piece goes on, I slowly place LEGO pieces onto the mat one by one. The piece starts out visually simple, but the abstract placement of the LEGOs continues. The piece ends when I decide not to wait anymore, and that moment varies, depending on the situation or what I'm thinking about the situation.

LIFEâ€™S A DRAG

â€œLifeâ€™s a Dragâ€ explores trans identity, gender performance, drag culture, and my experience as a transmasculine drag queen.

Performing as my drag persona Marlene Schiedich, I invited the audience to attend a non-traditional transgender reveal party. Patterned off a cis-heteronormative celebration to reveal the sex of an unborn child, this event asks â€œIs it a Boy or a Girl?â€ A five-layer cake was cut and served to the audience, revealing my â€œtrue gender.â€ The cut cake revealed the pattern of a transgender flag, eschewing both gender essentialism and the binary expectations even trans people face as they come out.

I then proceeded to regurgitate icing, â€œsugar coatingâ€ the language around the trans experience, repeating phrases and questions trans people often hear, specifically those I have personally heard, no matter how benign or insulting. This is an inversion of the witty banter drag queens are often expected to improvise for entertainment.

The standard â€œgender reveal partyâ€ divulges the sex of the child (in utero) to its (most likely) heterosexual parent(s). This celebration, precipitating the arrival of the child, narrowly categorizes a child into â€œboyâ€ and â€œgirlâ€ based on developing sex characteristics. This application of â€œgenderâ€ and public acknowledgement of the childâ€™s sex prepares the parents, family, and social group for an expectation of what a childâ€™s personality, interest, and identity might be, leading to a lifelong struggle confined in binary gender roles, for both trans children and cisgender children.

Drag queens are traditionally thought of as gay men â€œimpersonatingâ€ women, reducing them to a male/female binary. This ignores the history of drag which includes transwomen and transmen as leaders in the movement. Drag has recently found a mainstream foothold again, but this resurgence has primarily left out transgender people. Meanwhile, television programs like â€œI Am Jazzâ€ and â€œI Am Caitâ€ profit off the narratives of transgender individuals, often packaging transition stories as neat and binary.

The rituals and culture we participate in are made binary, despite attempts to change them. â€œLifeâ€™s A Dragâ€ continues a storied conversation around gendered performance, participation in trans narratives, and our complicit participation in the profit from gendered structures.

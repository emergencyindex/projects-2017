IF IN DOUBT, DONâ€™T

A fusion of a surreal, site-responsive installation and persona performance, â€œIf In Doubt, Donâ€™t,â€ took place in a garage in Glasgow, UK. The piece was framed as an experimental therapy for car addiction to be witnessed by an audience of one in a so-called â€œUndercover Treatment Center.â€

The performance is directly inspired by research on behavioral psychology, the car industry, and texts by the philosopher Timothy Morton. It is indirectly inspired by J. G. Ballardâ€™s novel Crash (a pornographic novel about technology), car pop culture, and by the performance artist/activist Guillermo Gomez-Pena.

Influenced by a recent trip to Vancouver, Canada, which I experienced as a car-dominated city, I wanted to question Western technology habits and our unsustainable car industry. In a sense, my critique of our car culture can be seen as a metaphor for the larger, human-made climate crisis. As one of the most urgent problems of our time, like many other artists, I find it immensely important to engage with it. I chose to focus on our relationship with cars is one way into the complex eco-critical territory. It is a way to process how to deal with difficult questions of human responsibility.

Despite the serious subject matter, I was eager for â€œIf In Doubt, Donâ€™tâ€ to be devised in a playful, satirical, and inquisitive manner. In an attempt to avoid being blatantly didactic, I wanted to bring the perplexing issues to life and make them more meaningful by using sensuousness to appeal to peopleâ€™s feelings and sensitivity. These considerations led to the decision to make it for an audience of one. As a result, we (six performers) ended up being placed in and around a car in a garage throughout the performance. One audience member at a time was invited to join us in this limited enclosed space where our self-invented therapy took place. Here, distinctive smells, live musical soundscapes, intimate spoken-word scenarios, and voluptuous, tactile sculpture costumes embraced audiences for a full-on sensory experience.

Excerpts from therapeutic DIY mantras repeated during the performance:

â€“ The car is not my mother

â€“ The car is not my father

â€“ It is not my lover

â€“ The car is here

â€“ I let go

â€“ The car is not my toy

â€“ I used to desire to become one with the carâ€”but I never really owned it and it never owned me

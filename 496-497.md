What is time? Is it the weight of the choices we make?

"Let Go" explores the workings of the decisions we make, the importance they have to us, the meaning we lend them, and the attempts to focus on the present by respecting the past.

During the durational performance I braided my hair into small plaits, intertwining pieces of string to each lock and then tying a small and heavy bag to each plait.

Duration:

4 hours

Materials:

1 bonsai (9 years old)

5 bobbins of unrefined string

1 pair of scissors

26 little bags (contents only known by the artist)

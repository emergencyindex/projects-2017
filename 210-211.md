Through an inquiry into micro-celebrification, advertising, persuasive public language, and the commodification of fame, I produce a performative critique of these areas within Western popular and consumer culture. I personally engage with and dissect the para-social relationships born from and maintained between the general public, fans, and those in positions of social power within popular culture, with a particular focus on the female position in mainstream media. Using myself as material in the work, I explore a slippage between performing as characters and reflecting on my personal life. I use techniques and materials such as green screen, drag, set design, sound, and costume to realize my work in both live and screen-based ways.

In this piece I used a steel structure that straddles the head and torso while lying on the ground. My arms move the structure back and it lifts and drags my limp body behind. An awkward difficult movement that moves at the pace of a walker. As I entered the room, the three assisting artists, who were in the lofts above, began to throw down red balloons with modified plastic soldiers (reoccurring objects I've owned since 2004) tied at the base of a string. As I carved my way out of the steel structure that was covered in dense black tape, the artists came down from the lofts and began releasing the air from the balloons.

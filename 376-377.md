"Of Wanting" is a two-hour performance exploring love, longing, and loss. A woman in red stands at the rear of a deep, bright room. She walks slowly, slowly forward, revealing the long red cords tying her to the wall. She continues to walk, snail-paced, intent; the cords gradually become taut, pulling tight; she cantilevers. The tension swells until, at last, her dress rips off. She is left standing in a white slip; a long red mark remains, dividing the room. She produces a white handkerchief from her dÃ©colletage, removes her red lipstick and waves the small white flag-a symbol of both goodbye and surrender-until her arm is too strained to move anymore.

The performance is inspired by an excerpt of a contemporary poem, handwritten on the wall, affixing the woman's gaze for its duration:

"I'm tired of cigarettes, coffee, words;

of wanting-more tired of trying not to want.

We should be what we are not: together-

all the length of our limbs, desire;

the long length of the branches, blossoms."

-Jeredith Merrin, from her collection, Shift

"INCONNU (Desconocido)" treats notions of identity and the complex relations between the colonizer and the colonized, the master and slave, the rich and poor, and the educated and illiterate. Based on readings of Frantz Fanon's Peau noire, masques blancs (Black Skins, White Masks), and Albert Camus' L'Ã‰tranger (The Stranger), "INCONNU" is an exploration of Western values and thoughts where language serves as a mechanism for control and, at the same time, of empowerment. Presented at the historical BibliothÃ¨que Schoelcher in Martinique, the performance reflects on themes of acculturation, adaptation, assimilation, survival, and self-preservation. Through this work, I continue with the development of a particular form and voice in my art practice.

It's midafternoon, the public has been waiting in the main lobby of the historic Schoelcher Library. From where I am, the high attic overlooking the main lobby, the space appears more sumptuous and intimidating. Covered with a black veil, I make my appearance following the sound of African drums that a local musician has volunteered to play. I move between the columns while I let feathers fall in the colors of the French flag; red, blue, and white, and, to finish, black ones that fall slowly to the main lobby. The drums get more intense and I descend the narrow spiral staircase. Once on the ground floor, I enter the main lobby. With slow movements, I proceed to take off the black bandages that cover my eyes. As I do so, red rose petals fall from my head. I reveal my upper torso showing long leaves of a plant from this region that are around my waist. With extreme care, I begin to crush the leaves one by one until they are no longer visible. When I am done, I exit the library, close the gates, and leave the audience locked and behind me. I cross the street, find the place where a day before I had found an old homeless man sleeping. I lay in the same position and stay there for a while. I hear the distant drums playing behind me. The performance is finished.

This fifteen-minute performance occurs within an installation that includes contemporary dance and storytelling elements, and it reclaims the piÃ±ata as a—lest we forget—Mexican custom. It is a performance that unpacks trauma in light of celebration and humor. Didactic and powerful, informative and thoughtful, kinda funny, intense and interactive, the only way to remind you the piÃ±ata is Mexican is by showing you how it dances. For the first five to six minutes, I personify a piÃ±ata by wrapping rope around my waist. Then, I throw my body without care, as if I'm being beaten by a bat. I call this the "PiÃ±ata Dance." I do the "PiÃ±ata Dance" all while I sing, "Dale, Dale, Dale," a Mexican traditional song, sung during piÃ±ata breaking rituals. The song is sung on and off for 30 seconds, mimicking the taking of turns during a piÃ±ata-breaking ritual. Even when my body falls to the floor from the impact, I still dance the "PiÃ±ata Dance" until the song ends causing a viscerally intense image. I finally get tired and say, "I am a piÃ±ata. Beaten and ripped apart but expected to pour sweets out of meâ€¦ onto you." I then proceed to compliment each and every person individually around the room. Metaphorically, I am giving them my sweetness, again personifying a piÃ±ata. Afterwards, I give improvisational directions, humorously, on how to participate in a piÃ±ata breaking. Then I invite audience members one by one to hit a piÃ±ata that I have hidden away from the gaze of judgment. While a one person hits the piÃ±ata, I sing "Dale, Dale, Dale" on the main stage in between ad-libbing about my mother's assimilation to US customs and how I learned this traditional Mexican song on the internet and not from Mexican relatives. I also diss Justin Bieber's cover of a Spanish song, and say other semi-political funny things in defense of preserving Mexican identity. When the piÃ±ata broke, I picked it up and poured out the candy for the whole audience. There was nothing but joy, and laughter. The audience picked up the candy and engaged in lots of conversation about the Mexican piÃ±ata breaking, in particular the song "Dale, Dale, Dale" and how it is often omitted from their personal experience.

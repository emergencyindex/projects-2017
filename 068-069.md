In my performance I invited participants to consider the idea that food can arouse you sexually, by serving "appetizers" that are considered aphrodisiacs (food that stimulates sexual desire) on a tray to gallery attendees. For centuries, people have explored using natural substances to improve their sex drive and pleasure. My performance explored three of these. People were invited to try each of them; there was a card on the tray explaining its purpose, and I was able to then discuss the idea that a food could be a sexual motivator. The aphrodisiacs were sliced cucumber with a "Good & Plenty" licorice on top. In a study that looked at how different smells stimulate sexual arousal, these foods are said to increase blood flow to the vagina: asparagus, with folic acid, boosts histamine production necessary for the ability to reach orgasm; celery contains two chemicals, androsterone and androstenol, which serve as sexual attractants when ingested. While many people knew of the notion of aphrodisiac stimulants, some were not familiar, and others were amused or doubtful of the suggestion. Some discussion unfolded regarding how food chemicals can affect your body in general.

This piece was performed as part of Day de Dada's "Love-Food-Love" event which included performances about food. While many of the performances dealt with people's love of certain foods, mine was concerning how food affects your love.

The goal of my performance work is to initiate dialogue surrounding myths and rituals of well-being and to go beyond traditional health practices, delving into more esoteric procedures and using non-medical practices to bring about awareness of the physical, mental, or spiritual health of my audience and what might affect them.

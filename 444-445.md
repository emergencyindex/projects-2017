"Untitled Cruising" is an interactive digital performance where real life becomes virtual reality. Utilizing mobile geolocational navigation, live-streaming, and chat technology, the audience is invited to follow me through text prompts in an online forum as I cruise through Birmingham's former and active gay cottaging sites. Traversing the gap between digital queer spaces and physical locations around the city of Birmingham, "Untitled Cruising" explores the politics of online anonymity and the transactional body in both the physical and virtual world, blurring the lines between the realms of online sex forums and former cruising sites.

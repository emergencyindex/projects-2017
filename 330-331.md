Audio Score read/improvised by performer #1:

â€œCan someone help me cross the street? I have never had a dream about this place, itâ€™s like there is no place here, it is always moving. I was born 4 miles that wayâ€¦ I crossed under police tape from a drive by shooting thereâ€¦ I walked into a bar over there with a brown skin friend from Algeria, a patron said â€˜F**k White People.â€™ Itâ€™s a Day Care now. My first girlfriend lived about a mile that wayâ€¦ There was blood on the sidewalk and door here in front of the gallery, I called Police and Fire three times, they never came. They had been at the crime scene, but didnâ€™t get it all. Last night I called 911 because a child was screaming for 10 minutes at the bus shelter. She didnâ€™t want anyone to come close to her; she wanted her parents. Hildegardâ€™s father had an office in this building, she remembers crawling up its stairs. Whatâ€™s happened to you here?â€

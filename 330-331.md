Audio Score read/improvised by performer #1:

"Can someone help me cross the street? I have never had a dream about this place, it's like there is no place here, it is always moving. I was born 4 miles that way… I crossed under police tape from a drive by shooting there… I walked into a bar over there with a brown skin friend from Algeria, a patron said 'F**k White People.' It's a Day Care now. My first girlfriend lived about a mile that way… There was blood on the sidewalk and door here in front of the gallery, I called Police and Fire three times, they never came. They had been at the crime scene, but didn't get it all. Last night I called 911 because a child was screaming for 10 minutes at the bus shelter. She didn't want anyone to come close to her; she wanted her parents. Hildegard's father had an office in this building, she remembers crawling up its stairs. What's happened to you here?"

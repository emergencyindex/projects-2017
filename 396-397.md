"If you ask me what I want, I'll tell you. I want everything" is a work in which I offer my body as a potential site of movement to be stored as a future sustainable energy source. Through relationality and exchange, and with echoes of a science-fiction narrative, I have built a choreography with a group of intimate and inspirational bodies exploring questions of the future and labour of queer relationships and desire in the face of climate change. Even though the work's propositions are disseminated through my body, the piece challenges the futurity of individuation and the ideology of "the solo," exploring the flesh in the wake of environmental decay.

This work has been formed collaboratively with a collective effort of bodies and movements merged and stored within my own. I shared studio time with friends, lovers, environmental workers, philosophers and activists, inspired by questions of the future sustainability of queer desire in the face of climate change. I am a flesh-body serving as a material root of my own methodology, and producing a systemic rupturing of movement, ropes, light, and sound.

When we are left with only our flesh as a natural resource, how can bodies stay sustainably useful together through movement and time?

"If you ask me what I want, I'll tell you. I want everything" is one of the final works in a two-year creative body of research, in which I have been exploring and creating towards my first feature film _Foxes_. Through performance, short videos, films, drawings, collages, and expanded cinema installations, I have been researching themes of queer desire, climate change, invisible genocide, and radical-positive apocalypse.

we made weather together. we made food together. we ate our cloud and our mist. we ate the snow and the low pressure system. passing the threshold of last. undecided weather. confused weather. a weather of uncertainty. a blackout. we dug our fists into the sand. we made potential, maybe.

This work and weather is inspired by creative and emotional exchanges with: Shannon Cooney, Johanna Linsley, Rodrigo Garcia Alves, Jared Gradinger, Richard James Hancock, Mika Risiko, Sandra Blatterer, Stephane Moun, Fercha Pombo, Maria F.Scaroni, Christa Holka, R.

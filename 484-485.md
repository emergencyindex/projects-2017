"Las Olvidadas/The Forgotten" is a performance/dance—a collaboration between Vanessa Vargas (choreography), Marisabel Dávila Lobo (performance), and Icli Zitella (sound design)—that stages the idea of oblivion in relation to space, time, perception, and territoriality. In this piece, we use the body as a migratory tool, a surface, a territory, but also a place to be forgotten. Overlapping video projections determine the path of our bodies and of the audience. "Las Olvidadas/The Forgotten" explores the notions of rootlessness, exile, and oblivion as an embodiment of invisibility, which we present not only as an internal journey, but also as a social and political phenomenon crossing boundaries between body and social practices.

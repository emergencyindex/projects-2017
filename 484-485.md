&â€ŒAacute;VILA LOBO

"Las Olvidadas/The Forgotten" is a performance/dance—a collaboration between Vanessa Vargas (choreography), Marisabel D&â€Œaacute;vila Lobo (performance), and Icli Zitella (sound design)—that stages the idea of oblivion in relation to space, time, perception, and territoriality. In this piece, we use the body as a migratory tool, a surface, a territory, but also a place to be forgotten. Overlapping video projections determine the path of our bodies and of the audience. "Las Olvidadas/The Forgotten" explores the notions of rootlessness, exile, and oblivion as an embodiment of invisibility, which we present not only as an internal journey, but also as a social and political phenomenon crossing boundaries between body and social practices.

My intent as an artist is to document a raw account of self-exploration that pushes certain limitations of "being" from philosophical, psychological, and aesthetic positions. "Bound/ary" sets the parameters that confine myself in an 8' x 8' drywall enclosure within a gallery space that I then remain in for 24 hours with minimal clothing (university restrictions prevented me from being naked), no food, no water, and no restroom. During this time I have two surveillance cameras inside of the box that connect to a TV outside of the box to allow the viewer a limited, yet dominant, position within the performance to surveil me. There are also two "peepholes" for the viewer to view inside of the box/ inside of me. This project publicizes the seemingly private space and isolates my identity leaving both myself and the viewer vulnerable. While in the box all I have to do is create, which accentuates a sensible self-existence that represents an extreme pendulum of my physical and psychological states. These fluctuating states fluently looped from invigorating manic outbursts to dull depressive lulls. This box uncomfortably represents my innermost being to whom my conscious self still reacts with confusion. Putting this in the context of art bestows upon the viewer a strange yet omniscient perspective of my unravelled self, which calls into question the blurred perception of public vs. private in many layers.

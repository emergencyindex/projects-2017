On the 12th of October, the world celebrates something with many different names; simply, it is the beginning of the longest and most systematic genocide in the history of the world. This performance was made in front of the Court of Copenhagen (KÃ¸benhavn Domstol) where many public executions occured in the past. During this action, a group of migrant artists friends wrote their thoughts about colonization onto my body, while I read out loud a text about how dogs were used as a weapon of fear and annihilation against Native Americans in colonial times.

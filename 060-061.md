On February 5, 1903, the staff of the radical newspaper Regeneracion hung a banner between their windows reading â€œLa Constitucion Ha Muerto,â€ and posed for a photograph. This was an anti-commemoration; the constitution was declared dead on February 5, 1857. The constitution was a liberalizing and anti-clerical document whose force was squandered during thirty years of dictator Diaz. On February 5, 1917, the dead constitution was finally swept away, replaced by another liberalizing and anti-clerical document, soon to be squandered, this time by the institutionalization of the revolutionary partisans.

On February 5, 2017, as commemoration and anti-commemoration, the ComitÃ© Magonista met in Mexico City at the site of that photograph, La Casa de El Hijo del Ahuizote. From there, the Magonistas marched to the Palacio des Bellas Artes, snuck inside and unfurled their declarations. The march continued to the Museo Nacional de Arte MUNAL, where two teams attempted to hang their banners but were prevented and ejected by security. The Magonistas continue the march and entered the main square, the ZÃ³calo, where a propaganda meeting, poetry reading, and pamphlet printing event occurred. The Magonistas demonstrated in front of the Presidential Palace, declared the dead constitution abolished, and returned to La Casa de El Hijo del Ahuizote to repeat, restage, and reproduce the 1903 photograph.

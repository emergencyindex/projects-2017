â€œSubversionâ€ is what I have called my proposal for the collective and participatory event by the same name, organized by the curator Itziar Elejalde in La Morada, Bilbao. â€œSubversionâ€ made me immediately think of JosÃ© RamÃ³n Morquillasâ€”in July 2007, the Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao decided to cancel his exhibition â€œMorquillas, lâ€™air du temps.â€

Initially I wanted to approach this from the point of view of artâ€”a delicate and complex task because of the ease of falling into rhetoric, banality, empty discourse, complacency, conformism, demagogy, and domestication. I thought about stacking newspapers, books, posters, banners, propaganda, books, computers, cables, and all kinds of media that 1% of the population uses to enact (dis)information in order to control the remaining 99%, and then burning it all. But this seemed too easy. I wanted to synthesize. After long reflections and analysis, I managed to sharpen my idea. I turned the issue around and the action I took was totally different.

To perform the action I use a suit, an analog cathode tube television screen, an extendable aluminum tube, a stool, a strobe light, a flexible neon light, a black hood and a small LED light.

The suit hangs on the wall, the rest is arranged on a table. I put on the suit. I lengthen the tube, and place the flexible neon light inside the screen. I put on the black hood and put the small LED light in my mouth. I put the screen on my head. I do all this in front of those present, and start to walk, dragging the aluminum tube all over the floor of space. I stop, plug in the strobe, place the stool down. When I try to get on the stool I fall to the ground from the weight of the screen on my head. When I fall the screen breaks. I get up and I cannot get the screen back on my head. Broken crystals are everywhere. I can kill myself. I get on the stool holding the broken screen with my hands and I stay motionless for a while. I throw the cathode tube to the ground. The action, which during its development is accompanied by a pressing music, is over.

Still today I wonder: where is the subversion in this action?

"Thaw" was an exploration of presence and permanence. It was an attempt to comprehend what it meant to completely inhabit my own body as well as the surrounding landscape-ultimately asking the question: "How do I leave my mark on the world?" Over eight days, I imprinted my body into a snow-covered pool of ice which lay at the base of an overturned birch tree. Each day I lay in the same spot for a period of five to fifteen minutes, depending on the severity of below-freezing temperatures and how quickly I lost feeling. Relying only on body heat, I melted the snow and ice beneath me while constantly changing positions and enduring the discomforts of going numb. By the last day, I had melted through six inches of snow and created a significant impression of my torso in the ice beneath-essentially re-inhabiting the space once occupied by the fallen tree.

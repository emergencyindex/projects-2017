Materials involved two 2' x 4' x 10' boards of lumber, two steel handles, two jumpsuits, mixed earth from the performing location, and physical actions that reference previous collaboration, that of catching and falling from one another's grip. We performed within a festival setting; surrounding us were vendor booths selling goods, musicians setting up, performing, and breaking down, and other performance artists roaming throughout the venue. We conducted our rigorous performance three times during the day and met the evening with absolute exhaustion, ironically highlighting the content of our work, which is generally about labor. All preparatory elements of the piece, i.e. going to the lumber yard to buy the boards, walking them a 1/2 mile to our hostel, preparing them for the next days performance, visiting the site the evening before to navigate our timing and walking 2 miles to the site, all influenced how we approached this unique performance.

"m&AElig;rathon" is a site-specific, durational performance structured thematically around being a strange form in a new place, bridging the gap between two locations, ritual and repeated action, and the strength of two companions powering each other through exhaustion.

Materials used in the performance were five slabs of concrete brought with us from Defibrillator Gallery in Chicago, IL and ten squares of wood cut on-site at Spread Art in Detroit, MI. Piece by piece we anointed each slab of concrete and each wooden square with two anointing solutions, one made from olive oil, bay leaves, and rosemary, and the other made from water, salt, and a lit match. Our wrists bound with thread, we carried each anointed piece one at a time from the Spread Art courtyard to a grassy expanse at the corner of Trumbull St. and W. Warren Ave., slowly building a public sculpture as the sun set behind us. After placing each piece, we sat together for a moment to build up strength and to check in with each other. Once the sculpture was complete, we took a short break, ate a sandwich, and video-called our loved ones back home. We then began to deconstruct the public sculpture, bringing each piece back to the Spread Art courtyard one at a time, to reconstruct the sculpture there.

The performance ended when the sculpture was complete at Spread Art and anointed with wine. The duration of this performance was 6 hours.

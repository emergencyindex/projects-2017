This performance was presented during a two day program curated around the theme of Ecstasy. It occurred across multiple spaces within 107 Projects in Sydney, Australia.

Over the last five years, I have been delving deeper into trance dance and performance under the guidance of mentors Tony Yap, Javanese dance master Agung Gunawan, and shaman Agus Riyanto.

This performance was the first time I was able to explore these learnings outside of Asia in a durational solo performance. The first evening of the performance was staged in a glass-walled stairwell lobby and could be seen from the street, the exhibition space, caf&eacute; and for those who chose to sit on the stairs. The audience could come and go at will. The space was dressed with a long drop of red fabric pierced in two rows by silver needles behind a low altar set with ritual implements. On the opposite wall, a mirror and  whip made of human hair hung.

The performance took place over a course of 90 minutes on Friday. I prepared the space in a ritual manner with frankincense and sound using a gong. A protective circle of sea shell fragments, salt, and communion wafers defined the performance area. Within the area, the dance took place and concluded with crossed needles piercing the skin above the heart, tugged by the red ribbons attached to a railing in the staircase.

When re-entering the space on Saturday night to continue the performance, I could completely immerse into a body/mind space for a three-hour dance.

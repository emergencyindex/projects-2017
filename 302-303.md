The total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 was visible within a band, the umbra, across the United States and passed from the Pacific to the Atlantic coasts. Finding myself serendipitously within the umbraâ€”without prior planningâ€”I decided on the few days preceding the event to instinctively make TEOTS costumes and perform three TEOTS rituals (one before, one during, and one after) at three different locations in Rabun Gap, Georgia to mark the 2.2 minutes of total darkness in the path of totality.

There was no audience except a few town folks passing by in cars, two dogs (in photo), nearby chickens, and a photographer. The celestial rite was performed to reset a new phase of positive energy during this time of great idealogical division and noise.

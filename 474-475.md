I acted as shaman and invited everyone from the audience to learn about their future through the reading of chocolates, playing with the stereotypes of women as witch doctors or fortune tellers. The chocolates were thrown like dice, and according to my own system, I interpreted the chocolates and explained the meaning to each participant. Many people reported they felt the chocolates were accurate and appropriate to their situations although I was not always aware of their specific concerns or questions.

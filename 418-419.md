â€œObeah (A Black Ritual)â€ contemplates the residue of an untraceable work by a similar title, â€œA Black Ritual (Obeah),â€ conceived controversially in 1940 by Agnes De Mille. With a cast of fifteen black female dancers chosen through the directorship of dancer-theorist Katherine Dunham, De Mille debuted her evening-length work in the American Ballet Theatre season to a shocked and disgruntled audience; leaving a trail of little ephemera from the evening.

In this 2017 departure from the remnants of that prolific evening, Reid and Anakwe activate grief as a choreographic tool to recollect in the off-site location of wellness center, MINKA brooklyn. Questioning the infinite potential of â€œblackenedâ€ remembering as the propensity for creative fabulation for what has been erased, and that infinite potentialâ€™s correlation to the elusiveness of deep water, sound artist Rena Anakwe and performing artist Katrina Reid propose a collective descent into the undercurrents of memory with an insistence on superstition to congeal past-present-future. Choreographing sound, architecture, and the body, a twinned and poetic reflection emerges of the kinship between dj-dancer, sister-sister, mother-daughter; a wake emerges. The wake in this piece responds to  Christina Sharpe and Dionne Brand, two thinkers working in the lineages of the Trans-Atlantic Diaspora, by taking up the folkloric symbolism of water as a material that both holds memory and proliferates futurity.

Moving the audience through the performance site throughout the work, there is an ushering by Reid and Anakwe towards a concluding collective fall: into grief as a source of generative contemplation, into the sensorium of the performative moment, into the beat or the groove, into deep celebration of what is unknown and forgotten.

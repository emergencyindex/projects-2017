"Forgetting" is a performance and a micro-scale, sociopolitical laboratory. We seek to interact around this progressive process that increasingly characterizes the evolution of our society and the world around us.

Is "forgetfulness" an unconsciously collective ritual, a sharing out of time, a transition to "here and now"? It is, perhaps, simply a temporal experience in a given space that impacts whole lives, beliefs, and ideologies. "Forgetting" implies our gaze towards oneself and towards others; it amplifies the sensation of absence or presence in an instant.

We want to share an obscure space with the public so that they can explore the sensations that link time and body, and memories with presence, society, and politics.

In this space we seek to live two other bodies: bodies carrying a lived experience, an exile body, a foreign body, a dancer, a musician. Two incarnated, incomplete, marked stories that seek to exist, barefoot, open-hearted, and lose themselves in the projected image.

Then black. The words of Milan Kundera, another exile, through an amplified voice, sometimes whispered, sometimes cried, intervene to remind us something. The echo of another world, of an old memory, of a deep desire.

Then black, silence. The bodies move and the sounds of the musical instruments emerge in a game of lights that evokes states of pre-awakening/post-awakening. Eyes wide open, inward. Uninterrupted listening is a passage, from evocation to affirmation of the moment. Time is important: the performance lasts four hours and we don't know what will happen.

We like to integrate and explore the possible reactions of the spectators. Our wish is to create an opportunity to "forget" one's loved one, "forget" one's thoughts, move away from one's past, or perhaps get away from the mental frenzies of the present moment. But above all, through this evolutionary performance, we wish to question ourselves. What is our role in or our contribution to the sociopolitical situation we are experiencing? We share the space with curious people, inviting everyone to move and follow the track of sound, visual, and tactile materials.

There is singing, percussion, cries, dances, wonder, doubt, a book in the center, and the light slowly fading. Shamanic cleansing in a theatrical performance.

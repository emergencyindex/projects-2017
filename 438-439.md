The body is my tool, the body is my artworkâ€”the body as my essence to this life. "No Head Neither Arms" is a solo dance where a world of flesh and bones appears. A body is turned upside down, challenging our vision. Breasts becomes eyes and flesh becomes material. What do we read from the body when social structures are peeled away? What qualifies this as a human body? The body will change, transform, and make us wonder. This piece challenges our expectations about and comments on the sexualized world, gender separation, and body ideals. We lose track, and something new appears. The body addresses the absurdity of the human body and makes us ask important questions that come from a vulnerable place.

A young, white body enters the stage. You read the body as being female. You don't see a head or arms. Feet, legs, butt, stomach, breasts, chest. You expect the body to be pretty, to act ideally like we have learned from magazines, from advertisements, from capitalism. Soon, the body starts to transform. It brings us to a world of flesh and bones where the body is nothing but this: a constant transformation providing us an unlimited amount of pictures. Pictures that keep transforming. A search fills the space and the space has time to change.

In the south of Thailand, in the popular tourist destination of the province of Krabi, on the island of Koh Lanta, live the indigenous people, called the Urak Lawoi. The Urak Lawoi are a nomadic marine tribe, who for more than five centuries have traveled and lived as fishermen in the sea of Thailand. Now, they must fight against capitalist gentrification, which impoverishes them, isolates them and damages their traditions and customs.

After a week of living and learning their way of life, I tied red ropes on my feet, and walked towards the sea dragging two heavy bags of sand, with a tray of cooked small fish in my hands and a couple of live crabs in a can. After entering the sea I ate and offered the fish to the public. Next I sat down in the sand with my legs out in front and I released the crabs to walk over my legs.

The act of looking backward is a ghostly, impossible, and unreachable act. â€œNeverâ€ is an extremely short but rigorous performance. I force myself through the neon green, fuzzy, fleece, constricting tube that acts as Peter Panâ€™s shadow. The audience acts as witness for things that are found unnamable, unknowable, and impossible. Growing up as a queer child presents a difficulty when you have no way of explaining why you do not see yourself reflected back in the world around you. Pan does not have a shadow and possesses no way of looking backward. â€œNeverâ€ attempts to make present the absence or lack of shadow. By crawling through the tube, I embody Panâ€™s shadow or reflection as a form of bringing out what was already queer.

Taking the transparent form of a pyramid scheme, the homophonic "PyramidsTheme" performance invites viewers to invest in a regenerative drawing project allowing participants to buy and/or create original works of art to be resold to friends and family. This proprietary drawing system coupled with exclusive materials can transform the most inept makers into prosperous artists and dealers. This patented system is promoted through professional artist testimonials, which recognize their achieved success and notoriety through their dedicated participation. "PyramidsTheme" transforms the audience into accomplished craftspeople, through digital and live audio/visual presentations.

â€œFor Every Page That Unfoldsâ€ is a performance installation. The modular sculpture in this piece is made of L-shaped wooden, reflective platforms and metal structures. The platforms stand flat at a 90-degree angle when placed on the metal structures, which act as a bearing strong enough to support the artistâ€™s body. There are magnets attached on each folded metal piece and the entire sculpture sits on a plane of iron sand.

During the performance, I stood on top of the flat platform and turned each of the structures from inside to outside, securing them in a position that could hold my weight. Each module could only be balanced at a certain bearing based on the unique fold of each metal piece. The goal was to construct an elevated and steady platform, using all the modules, to build a bridge over the iron sand. Throughout the process, relocating each piece continuously shifted the plane beneath it.

This performance installation acts as a metaphor for a bridge that both falls to pieces and can be reconstructed. The adjustable modules resemble obstacles that create a platform to emulate a surface which is both functional and steady, but also untrustworthy; an embodiment of the artistâ€™s experience of exile and immigration.

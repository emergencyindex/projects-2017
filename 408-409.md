On a remote beach, I lie on the ground in a fetal position, blindfolded. A line of fire gradually surrounds me, creating a circle. As the fire progresses around me, I stand up and walk inside of the circle of fire. My feet stumble on the uneven rocks. Unable to cross the fire, I walk in circles aimlessly. My hands extended, I feel the warmth around me to be guided, yet I go nowhere. When the flames have died I collapse to the ground, never realizing my freedom.

This performance addresses the conflicting relationship between the conscious and the unconscious. The condition of mankind is characterized by blindness to oneself. As such, I chose to explore the psychological limitations of consciousness while highlighting the possibility to transcend such limitations and ultimately transcend oneself. However, ignorance and comfort win all too often; they lead to repetition and a profound sense of the absurdity of life. Being able to cross the fire also means accepting the necessity to step into the world of dangers that lie beyond it. This work is a corporeal meditation on the never-ending necessity to grow out of our older boundaries and the consequences of not doing so. I used symbolism drawing from mythology and archetypal ideas to bypass the intellect altogether and create a language reminiscent of forgotten dreams and memories that were never livedâ€“ things that both belong to everyone and escape everyone.
